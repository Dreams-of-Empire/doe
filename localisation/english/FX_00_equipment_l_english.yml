Under ideal conditions, the R.Pz.B. 54 can penetrate heavy tanks’ armour with its 8,8-centimetre rockets, already used by the Raketenwerfer 43 rocket launchers. As a drawback, the R.Pz.B. 54 produces a lot of smoke upon firing. Many shipped over from Germany given Belarus' lack of anti tank weapons."

CRU_infantry_equipment_0_desc: "The Mauser Model 1902 is one of several Mauser rifles in service with the Mexican military, but is currently by far the most common. Chambered in 7x57mm, the Model 1902 is a highly modified Spanish Model 1893 Mauser integrating several parts and design elements from the later Mauser Model 1898. The Model 1902, which was purchased in large quantities from the German company DWM, is nearly identical to the domestically produced Model 1910."

While effective, the Mondragón has always suffered reliability issues and is expensive to produce. The Model 1929 is a modernised and easier to manufacture version of the original Mondragón."

GER_medium_tank_equipment_1: "Panzerkampfwagen III"
GER_medium_tank_equipment_1_short: "Panzer III"
GER_medium_tank_equipment_1_desc: "As early as 1934/35, General Heinz Guderian envisioned two basic types to act as the most numerous equipment for the future German Panzer Divisions. The first vehicle was to be armed with anti-tank gun and two machine guns and the second one was to be a support vehicle armed with a larger caliber gun. The first one eventually became known as Panzerkampfwagen III, which was to be a standard tank for the three light companies of a tank battalion. The second one became known as Panzerkampfwagen IV."
GER_medium_tank_equipment_2: "Panzerkampfwagen IV"
GER_medium_tank_equipment_2_short: "Panzer IV"
GER_medium_tank_equipment_2_desc: "Designed as an infantry-support tank, the Panzer IV was not originally intended to engage enemy armor - that function was performed by the lighter Panzer III. However, with the flaws of pre-war doctrine becoming apparent and in the face of Soviet T-34 tanks, the Panzer IV soon assumed the tank-fighting role of its increasingly obsolete cousin. The most widely manufactured and deployed German tank of the Second World War, the Panzer IV was used as the base for many other fighting vehicles."
GER_medium_tank_equipment_3: "Panzerkampfwagen V 'Siegfried'"
GER_medium_tank_equipment_3_short: "Siegfried"
GER_medium_tank_equipment_3_desc: "Siegfried is the nickname of the Panzerkampfwagen V which saw extensive use in the German Army after being developed in 1942. It was based on the experience the German Army made in Russia with the T-34 and was built as counter to it and also to act as replacement to the obsolete Panzer IIIs and Panzer IVs. Its excellent combination of firepower, protection and mobility made it the benchmark for other nation’s Tanks. The Siegfried became known as one of the best Tanks of 2nd Great War."

NAR_infantry_equipment_0_desc: "The Model 1903 was developed at Springfield Arsenal when, following the Spanish-American war, the United States deemed the Krag–Jørgensen rifle inadequate on account of its weak action; at its core, the 1903 was an attempt to combine beneficial features of both the Krag and captureds Spanish Mausers. Beginning just before the Weltkrieg, the rifle was gradually adopted along with the .30-06 cartridge, a process that would take several years."

NAR_infantry_equipment_1_short: "M1903A1 Springfield"
NAR_infantry_equipment_1_desc: "The M1903A1 Springfield was adopted by the US Army in 1929 as the 'U.S. Rifle, Caliber .30-06, M1903A1'. It incorporated a pistol-grip, chequered buttplate, serrated trigger, and several smaller improvements into the original 1903 design. "

NAR_infantry_equipment_2_desc: "With start of the Civil War, the new Army Department of the U.S. published a request for semi-automatic rifle designs. The Colt company submitted a .276 calibre rifle to the ensuing trials in 1938. The Colt M1937, the latest in a line of guns stemming from a design by J. E. Browning (half brother of John Moses Browning), is a gas-operated design using 108 parts. The M1937 was accepted in service in the end of 1938, after modification at the request of the Ordnance Department from .276 to .30-06 calibre."

NAR_infantry_equipment_3_desc: "In 1940, the Ordnance Department put out a request for a new 'light rifle' or carbine, though the exact requirements for the weapon were not finalised until 1941. Colt did not submit a true carbine design, as it was otherwise pre-occupied, but with the death of J. E. Browning, they put contractor David Marshall Williams, who had begun work on a short-stroke gas piston design, on the project. Williams incorporated his short-stroke piston into an existing Colt prototype and shortened it in line with the requirements of the Ordnance department. The new rifle would eventually be accepted into service."

NAR_infantry_at2_desc: "The M1942 Recoilless Rifle is a shoulder-fired anti-materiel weapon developed by the two engineers 'Kroger' and 'Musser' as part of a U.S. Army Infantry Section freelance project. The M1942 was developed in response to rapid improvements in armour which greatly diminished the effectiveness of anti-tank rifles small enough to be man-portable. The M1942 Recoilless Rifle has an effective range of 400 yards, a maximum range of nearly 5,000 yards, and is more accurate compared with the old M1942 anti-tank rifle. It quickly was nicknamed 'pocket artillery' by the soldiers who used it."

While the M1943 has its flaws, like a poor range and an easily damaged Infrared emitter, the M1 still has tremendous value when used correctly."
#M3 sniperscope:
NAR_night_vision2: "Infrared Sniperscope, Model 1946"
NAR_night_vision2_short: "M1946 Sniperscope"
NAR_night_vision2_desc: "In response to the poor reception of the M1943 Sniperscope, the Sniperscope M1946 was adopted. With almost twice the effective range of the M1943, a more robust infrared light source, and the T23 flash hider, the M1946 is a vast improvement over its predecessor, though some soldiers complain of the light source bleeding into the visible spectrum and thus giving away their position."

#Trains
# Soviet Class FD # Name means “Steam Locomotive Type 1”:
RUS_train_equipment_1: "Paravoz Tip 1"
RUS_train_equipment_1_short: "Type P1"
RUS_train_equipment_1_desc: "Designed in 1931, the Class P1 replaced many of the American-built Class Ye locomotives serving on the Russian network. In 1936, the locomotive class was fitted with a superheater to improve power output, creating the P1-21 variant. The solid performance of the class quickly led to massive orders and became the most popular locomotive on the Russian network, with workshops built solely for the production of this type."
# Soviet Class L # Name means “February Road Steam Locomotive”:
RUS_train_equipment_2: "Paravoz Fevralskaya doroga"
RUS_train_equipment_2_short: "Class F"
RUS_train_equipment_2_desc: "Developed at the Kolomna Factory and named after the February Railway connecting Moscow and Petrograd, the Class F locomotives are economical and suited for serving on the vast Russian railway network. Without a trailing wheel set and complicated components, serial production of the type was faster and cheaper  compared to the Type P1."

UKR_artillery_equipment_1_desc: "The 10,5-cm le.F.H. 33 is the standard artillery piece of the Deutsches Heer, adopted for service in 1933 and used by all divisions and artillery battalions. This gun was developed in 1928-29 by Rheinmetall, and was a major advance on its predecessor the 10,5-cm le.F.H. 16 - a completely new three-point split trail gun carriage provides more stability and increases the traverse to 56 degrees alongside with the sighting mechanism to make it easier to fire at moving targets."
UKR_artillery_equipment_2: "15-cm schwere Feldhaubitze Modell 36"
UKR_artillery_equipment_2_short: "15-cm s.F.H. 36"
UKR_artillery_equipment_2_desc: "The 15-cm schwere Feldhaubitze 36, nicknamed Immergrün ('Evergreen'), is the basic division-level heavy howitzer, serving alongside the smaller but more numerous 10,5-cm le.F.H. 33. The gun originated with a contest between Rheinmetall and Krupp, both of whom entered several designs that were all considered unsatisfactory for one reason or another. In the end the army decided the solution was to combine the best features of both designs, using the Rheinmetall gun on a Krupp carriage. In 1935 the Army drafted a requirement for a lightened version of the gun which could be towed by a single horse team in one piece, for which a new proposed design from Rheinmetall was selected."
UKR_artillery_equipment_3: "17-cm Kanone Modell 40 in Mörserlafette"
UKR_artillery_equipment_3_short: "17-cm K. 40 Mrs.Laf."
UKR_artillery_equipment_3_Desc: "The 17-cm Kanone 40, built by Krupp and Hannoversche Maschinenbau, is heavy corps-level gun. In the field, the gun delivers great damage, but also has a great disadvantage of requiring a long period of time to tear down for transport. A notable innovation on the 17-cm K. 40 is the \"double recoil\" or dual-recoil carriage. The dual-recoil mechanism absorbs all of the recoil energy with virtually no movement of the box trail upon firing, thus making for a very accurate weapon."

UKR_anti_tank_equipment_1: "3,7-cm Panzerabwehrkanone Modell 36"
UKR_anti_tank_equipment_1_short: "3,7-cm Pa.K. 36"
UKR_anti_tank_equipment_1_desc: "Design of a horse-drawn, 3,7-cm anti-tank gun (designated 3,7-cm Pa.K. 28) by Rheinmetall commenced in 1924. By the early 1930s, it became apparent that horse-drawn artillery is obsolete, and the gun was modified for motorised transport, allowing it to be towed at highway speeds. Nicknamed by soldiers 'Heeresanklopfgerät' ('army door-knocking device'), the re-designated 3,7-cm Pa.K. 36 is the main anti-tank weapon of Deutsches Heer and easily can manage with enemy light tanks."
UKR_anti_tank_equipment_2: "7,5-cm Panzerabwehrkanone Modell 40"
UKR_anti_tank_equipment_2_short: "7,5-cm Pa.K. 40"
UKR_anti_tank_equipment_2_desc: "The 7,5-cm Pa.K. 40 was developed after reports of new enemy tank designs began to reach Berlin in 1939. The project was initially given low priority, but following the growing tensions with France and the appearance of heavily armoured tanks, it was given an increased priority. In terms of armour-piercing action, the Pa.K. 40 is superior to the similar guns, but have less effective rollback damping systems, as a result of which the gun is behind analogues to quickly change position."
UKR_anti_tank_equipment_3: "12,8-cm Panzerabwehrkanone Modell 43"
UKR_anti_tank_equipment_3_short: "12,8-cm Pa.K. 43"
UKR_anti_tank_equipment_3_desc: "The 12,8-cm Pa.K. 43 is the new anti-tank gun developed initially as a field gun known as the Kanone 43. However, once heavier tanks started to appear the design requirements were altered to include an anti-armour role. The 12,8-cm Pa.K. 44 has a good anti-tank performance over long to extreme-long ranges - 1,800–2,700 metres and beyond - while also doubling as an effective field gun when firing high-explosive shells. But since it was not possible to install a 12,8-cm barrel on the carriage of a conventional anti-tank gun, a special carriage for the gun was designed. The high profile of the gun had to be maintained, which makes the gun extremely visible."

UKR_anti_air_equipment_1: "2-cm Flugzeugabwehrkanone Modell 36"
UKR_anti_air_equipment_1_short: "2-cm Fla.K. 36"
UKR_anti_air_equipment_1_desc: "The 2-cm Fla.K. 30 automatic anti-aircraft cannon was developed by Rheinmetall in 1930, and the Deutsches Heer began to receive guns in 1933. In 1936, due to the growth of tensions, Mauser modernised the gun - the upgraded model received the designation 2-cm Flugzeugabwehrkanone 36 and was adopted by the German army. The principle of operation of the Fla.K. 36 mechanisms remains the same - the use of recoil force with a short barrel stroke, but otherwise is similar with only increased the rate of fire to 220 rounds per minute and slightly lowered overall weight to 420 kg."
UKR_anti_air_equipment_2: "3,7-cm Flugzeugabwehrkanone Modell 37"
UKR_anti_air_equipment_2_short: "3,7-cm Fla.K. 37"
UKR_anti_air_equipment_2_desc: "The original 3,7-cm gun was developed by Rheinmetall in 1935. The cannon had an overall length of 89 calibres, which allowed a 4,800 metres maximum ceiling. The Fla.K. 35 was only produced in small numbers, and production had already ended in 1936. Development continued, focusing on replacement of the existing cumbersome dual-axle mount with a lighter single-axle one, resulting in a 3,7-cm Fla.K. 36 with the practical rate of fire raised to 120 rounds per minute. A new, simplified sighting system introduced the next year led to the otherwise-identical 3,7-cm Fla.K. 37 which quickly became the main variant of the gun for the German Army."
UKR_anti_air_equipment_3: "8,8-cm Flugzeugabwehrkanone Modell 41"
UKR_anti_air_equipment_3_short: "8,8-cm Fla.K. 41"
UKR_anti_air_equipment_3_desc: "Initially developed in 1930 by Krupp the 8,8-cm Flugzeugabwehrkanone 30, commonly known as 'acht-acht' ('eight-eight'), was later modified by Rheinmetall. The versatile carriage allows the 8,8-cm Fla.K. to fire in a limited anti-tank mode when still on its wheels, and many consider the 8,8-cm Fla.K. line to be one of the best of its time. The Rheinmetall Fla.K. 41 is a second generation 8,8-cm gun, which some generals say is 'almost equal to the 12,8-cm cannon'. While having good characteristics, the Fla.K. 41 has problems in service, and is used mainly where it can be properly maintained."

The open frames of the most common steel version have short hinged legs to adjust elevation and are sized to fit the 32-centimetre rocket, but adapter rails are provided to allow the 28-centimetre rockets to fit. The s.W.G. 40 also can be mounted on schwere Wurfrahmen 40 frames attached to the sides of different vehicles."

UKR_rocket_artillery_equipment_2_desc: "The 21-cm Raketenwerfer 42 is a five-barreled multiple rocket launcher mounted on the towed carriage derived from that of the 3,7 cm Pa.K. 36 anti-tank gun. The launchers are organised into batteries of six with three batteries per battalion. Intended to provide the fire support and settle smokescreens, the R.W. 42 are mainly used as rocket artillery and almost don't participate in chemical warfare."

UKR_light_tank_equipment_1_short: "P-34"
UKR_light_tank_equipment_1_desc: "With German domination came adaptation of the Ukrainian language, with the term 'Panz', shortened from the German term 'Panzer', eventually solidifying as the Ukrainian word for 'tank'.\n\nThe Panz model of 1934 was the first domestically designed Ukrainian tank accepted into service. It borrowed heavily from the Canadian Vickers Mark E as well as interwar German designs, and sported a 20mm cannon besigned by the Italian Breda company. The vehicle received mixed feedback from soldiers in the field for its inadequate main armament and moderately failure-prone transmission."

UKR_light_tank_equipment_2_short: "P-I Vasyl"
UKR_light_tank_equipment_2_desc: "Soon after the adoption of the P-34, the Ukrainian military abandoned chronological tank nomenclature in favour of a system reminiscent of that of the German Army, pre-designating the next tank to be adopted as the P-I.\nWhat would ultimately fill that name was the Vasyl, named in honour of the king himself. A development of the earlier P-34, the P-I Vasyl addressed its predecessor's shortcomings, sporting an extended chassis and numerous revisions to nearly every component. The vehicle also sported a new German 20mm cannon, which, while of the same calibre as the older Breda gun, proved to be much more effective in training and combat alike."
UKR_light_tank_equipment_3: "Shvydkokhidnyj Panz II Stanyslaviv"
UKR_light_tank_equipment_3_short: "SP-II Stanyslaviv"
UKR_light_tank_equipment_3_desc: "With the Russian fast-tank concept so essential to that country's rearmament program and with new heavier vehicles entering development, the Ukrainian army began development of an agile new light tank of its own. The Shvydkokhidnyj Panz II, as the vehicle would be designated in Ukrainian service, was able to fill a variety of roles on the battlefield due to its remarkable speed and handling. The name 'Stanyslaviv' was affixed to the vehicle in a display of irredentism, rare under Hapsburg rule of Ukraine, over Austrian-held Galicia."

UKR_heavy_tank_equipment_1_desc: "Rooted in the Versuchskonstruktion project, the 'Kaiserlichepanzer', as the Krupp company had taken to calling it in a ploy to appeal to the vanity of the Kaiser himself, was completely rejected by the German Army in 1931. Not to be detered, however, a second prototype with a much less failure-prone suspension system was offered to the Ukrainian government mere months later. Ukraine purchased the vehicle and after a small revision to its still somewhat problematic suspension, the vehicle was adopted under the German 'Kaiserlichepanzer' name."
