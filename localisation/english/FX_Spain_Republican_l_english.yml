### Events ###
repspain.0.t: "The Republic of Spain"
repspain.0.d: "Republicanism in Spain is not something new on our peninsula. The first attempt at a Spanish Republic was in 1873, following the abdication of King Amadeo I. While the first republic only lasted for just over a year, with it being opposed by both Monarchists and Nationalists alike, the fact that it existed at all says something. It would become something to strive towards for us republicans. \n\nA new Spanish Republic would not arrive on the peninsula until the dictatorship of Miguel Primo de Rivera was over. This dictatorship was one that our King let happen in Spain, a sin we could not allow. In 1931, the Second Spanish Republic was established, nearly 60 years after the first. At first, the republic faced many coup attempts, and not everyone was ready to accept its rule. It would culminate in the Christmas season of 1935, when a coup would be the final spark to light the fire of civil war. Monarchists and Nationalists have taken up arms against our government, after biding their time in the shadows. \n\nNow, the Spanish Republic is surrounded by the traitorous Monarchists and Nationalists, with the Socialists breaking free as well. This civil war will cost many lives, but it will be the test to see if the Republic is going to survive, or if its destiny will be the same as the first Republic's."

repspain.1.t: "Protests in Rif"

repspain.3.a: "Long Live the Republic!"

repspain.4.t: "Galicia Under Our Control"
repspain.4.d: "We have managed to push northwest and capture Galicia. The region has served through the civil war as a base for the Nationalist uprising. With this region under our control, we can say to have succeeded in securing the northern territories of Spain."

repspain.5.t: "Fall of the Monarchists!"
repspain.5.d: "The Monarchists and the Nationalists have been defeated, and with them, we have managed to defeat the forces that have tried to reestablish old and autocratic regimes over Spain.

repspain.6.t: "Conflict With the Socialists"

repspain.7.t: "Valencia Under Our Control"

repspain.8.t: "Barcelona Under Our Control"
repspain.8.d: "We have managed to push northeast and capture Barcelona. It is one of the most important cities in Spain, and the center of the Socialist revolution. With this city firmly under our control, it will mark the end of the Socialists."

repspain.9.t: "The Civil War is Over!"

repspain.11.t: "Anti-Government Protests"

While this could be a good idea to regain some stability, there are many in the government that oppose such measures."

repspain.15.t: "Returning Stability"

While there is no shortage of candidates, many do not really have any chance to succeed. \n\nBut there are two possible candidates that can take on the role as President of Spain. The first is Manuel Azaña, leader of the Republican Left who served as prime minister through the civil war. He choice would be popular with socialists and left of center republicans, but not so popular with anyone else. The second is Alejandro Lerroux, leader of the Radical Republicans and a former prime minister of Spain. He would be popular in the republican center and with those who oppose Azaña as president, but not with the left-wing. It will nevertheless be up to the Cortes to decide who is going to be the next president of Spain."
repspain.17.a: "A Majority Supports Manuel Azaña"

# Focus Tree Events #

repspain.103.t: "New Republican Election"
repspain.103.d: "Finally Spain is ready for new elections. While there have been concerns that we will try to directly influence the vote, in order to make the country vote in a certain way, the government has reassured the public many times that this will be a free election. There are two possible outcome of this election. Either the Republican Left will secure a majority, or the Republican Center and Right will secure their own. \n\nThe Republican left-wing is made up primarily of the Republican Left of Manuel Azaña, and the Republican Union of Diego Martínez Barrio. Smaller parties also exist in this alliance, among them some regionalist parties. The Republican Left wing wants to make Spain a secular and modern state, free from catholic influences. They also want to reintegrate the Socialists back into Spanish society. \n\nThe Republican Center and Right wing, by contrast, are made up primarily of the Radical Republican Party of Alejandro Lerroux and the Liberal Republican Right of President Niceto Alcalá-Zamora, with smaller parties filling in the gaps. The Republican Center and Right have similar goals to the Republican Left, but are less radical and willing to reintegrate conservative forces back into Spanish society. \n\nIt would, for the most part, be up to the President on who he will approach in order to form a government. But in reality, these are the only two options."
repspain.103.a: "The Republican Left Forms a Government"
repspain.103.b: "The Republican Center and Right Forms a Government"

While the opposition opposes this, there is nothing stopping Azaña from doing it."
repspain.104.a: "Democracy Should be Allowed for Socialists Too"

repspain.105.t: "Francisco Largo Caballero Found Dead"
repspain.105.d: "News from Oslo has recently reached us that the socialist politician Francisco Largo Caballero was found dead in his apartment. It was obvious that someone had managed to force their way into his apartment and stab him in his chest. While some in the Norwegian government suspect that we had something to do with his death, they do not have concrete proof of it. Regardless of who did it, it is not good news when Spanish citizens are found dead."
repspain.105.a: "We Hope he Will Rest in Peace"

repspain.106.t: "Agreement With the Socialists"
repspain.106.d: "After hours of meetings and discussions, an agreement has been reached between the government and socialist politicans.

repspain.107.t: "Negotiations With the Anarchists"

repspain.108.t: "What To Do About Religious Education?"
repspain.108.d: "In our government, some have argued in favor of closing down schools that have a religious focus or are owned by religious organizations. They say that, just like how state and church shall be separate, so too should school and church. There are some that oppose this motion, arguing that there is nothing wrong with these schools, so long as they follow the law. A proposed law that bans religious education was passed in Cortes, and is ready for the president to sign it into law, should he choose to do so."
repspain.108.a: "The President Will Sign It"
repspain.108.b: "The President Will Veto the Bill"

repspain.109.t: "Prime Minister Maura Meets With the Conservatives"
repspain.109.d: "While many of the leading figures in the Confederation of Autonomous Rights are currently in our captivity, or have fled the country, Prime Minister Miguel Maura Gamazo has begun to meet with leading figures of the party still living free in Spain.

Regardless of who did it, it is not good news when Spanish citizens are found dead."
repspain.110.a: "We Hope he Will Rest in Peace"

repspain.111.t: "Agreement Reached With the Conservatives"
repspain.111.d: "After hours of meetings and discussions, an agreement has been reached between the government and conservative politicans. In order for the government to get their support, it has agreed to a list of demands. Among these demands is the demand of embracing some Catholic morals that can fit into our modern society. But with this agreement in hand, the government will have more support both in the Cortes and among the public."
repspain.111.a: "We Will Honour the Agreement"

repspain.112.t: "Negotiations With Renovación Española"
repspain.112.d: "The government has in recent days negotiated with politicians from the monarchist and conservative Renovación Española. While we have destroyed them in the civil war, they still sway some influence over the conservative right, and negotiations might be the way to reintegrate the right-wing of Spanish politics. Uphelding aspects of Religion and Tradition may have its positive sides after all."
repspain.112.a: "Good to Negotiate With You"

repspain.150.t: "The Spanish Republic Wants to Join the Entente"
repspain.150.d: "Our southern neighbour, the Spanish Republic, has approached us in order to request entry into the Entente. With them on our side, our alliance would secure an extra ally against Germany or the Soviet Union. The downside would be that we might need to provide for Spain's own defence if war should come."

repspain.151.a: "Spain and France Will Fight Together!"

repspain.152.t: "The French Reject our Entry into the Entente"
repspain.152.d: "The French Republic has answered our request to join the Entente. Unfortunately, they have rejected us. While this rejection is disheartening, the fact that they still consider us the legitimate government of Spain may be a glimmer of hope. Our government will take this as a loss for France."
repspain.152.a: "This Will be Their Loss"

repspain.153.t: "The Spanish Republic Sends Support"
repspain.153.d: "The Spanish Republic has acknowledged our fight for freedom and republicanism, and has sent their support to us. We will of course reply with our thanks. Our eventual victory will usher in a new era of friendship and brotherhood between Spain and Portugal."

repspain.154.t: "A Latin Friendship"
repspain.154.d: "The ties between the Spanish and French Republics are growing stronger day by day. As latin countries, we share more than just having similar political systems.

repspain.154.a: "The Future Looks Bright for Madrid and Paris"

repspain.155.t: "Spanish Embassy Reopens in Mexico"
repspain.155.d: "When the Spanish Civil War began, the Spanish embassy in Mexico closed down, with its employees traveling home to Spain or blending into the Mexican population.

We will of course oblige to their request, but there are differing views on how to welcome their Ambassador."
repspain.155.a: "A Proper Welcome is Required"
repspain.155.b: "A Welcome Doesn't Need to be Warm"

This has indeed helped to build a strengthened relationship with our Hispanic brethren in Mexico City."
repspain.156.a: "This is a Good Sign"

repspain.157.t: "A Cold Welcome from Mexico"
repspain.157.d: "It was always a given that our embassy in Mexico would be returned to us.

After being questioned by Mexican police, he was finally welcomed by a minor government official, who gave him the keys to the Embassy which he then had to walk to."
repspain.157.a: "At Least it is a Welcome.."

repspain.158.t: "New Spanish Ambassador in Argentina"
repspain.158.d: "When the Spanish Civil War started, the Spanish embassy in Argentina closed down, with its employees traveling home to Spain or blending into the Argentine population.

repspain.159.a: "A Possible Argentine Friend"

repspain.160.t: "An Half-Hearted Argentine Welcome"
repspain.160.d: "It was always a given that our embassy in Argentina would be returned to us. While we have no ground to criticize the Argentine government on that front, they did give our Ambassador a rather half-hearted welcome, with a minor government employee simply handing him a letter and the keys. In the letter, they welcome us, but also request that we leave them out of our politics."
repspain.160.a: "We Will Not Worry Them Then.."

repspain.161.t: "International Recognition is Growing"
