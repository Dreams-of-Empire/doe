### Events
romania.0.t: "The Kingdom of Romania in 1936"
romania.0.d: "In 1883, the Romanian king Carol I made a secret deal with the Triple Alliance that entailed a defensive alliance with Austria-Hungary. Romania remained neutral for the first two years of the Great War. In 1916, Romania officially joined the Entente and declared war upon the Central Powers.\n\nThe Austro-Hungarian army in Galicia pushed far into Moldova, capturing the city of Galati. The combined Romanian-Entente made a valiant last stand in Bucharest. Romania was turned into nothing more than a rump state subservient to Germany.\n\nWhen the Central Powers capitulated to the Entente in 1919, Romania was freed from German bondage. Representatives from both Bukovina and Transylvania arrived in Bucharest to declare union with Romania. Ferdinand I's reign would be characterized by stabilization of the socio-economic position of Romania. With the appointment of Prince Michael as the heir to the throne, Prince Nicholas was appointed regent in behalf of his nephew; however, the other members of the regency deposed Nicholas for planning a coup against the incoming king; and Nicholas went into a self-imposed exile into Transylvania.\n\nRomania's democratic and constitutional monarchy is slowly trending more towards a populist dictatorship; while the National Peasants Party still holds majority in the Government; other opposition parties such as the Iron Guard can take drastic actions in hopes to rising into power. The incoming elections will truly determine the fate of the Romanian Government; whether it will still hold its status quo; provide a more progressive government or become a populist dictatorship is still to be seen."
romania.0.a: "A new future for Romania!"
romania.1.t: "Appointing the New Regent"
romania.1.d: "The recent death of Constantin Sarateanu has left the position of regent vacant. His royal highness, Prince Michael has instructed the council to begin the appointment of a new regent. While the obvious choice maybe getting a person from the most popular party; there are also other options available."
romania.1.a: "Appoint from the ruling party"
romania.1.b: "Try courting the PNL"
romania.1.c: "Maybe a coalition with PSDR won't hurt"
romania.2.t: "Coronation of Michael I"
romania.2.d: "Today is the day, Prince Michael son of the former King Carol II has just became 16 years old allowing him to take the Romanian kingship. In a ceremony at the Patriarchal Cathedral in Bucharest, the young King was crowned with the Steel Crown and anointed by the Patriarch of the Romanian Orthodox Church. While the king retains significant powers, Michael is a figurehead largely sidelined by the Prime Minister, and there is little reason for this to change anytime soon."
romania.2.a: "God Save King Michael!"
romania.3.t: "The London Stock Market Crashed!"
romania.3.d: "Yesterday, the London stock market crashed, plunging the world into a depression. Already it is being labelled the so-called 'Black Monday' crash. Our nation has strong economic ties to the United Kingdom and many British companies are now shutting down their Romanian factories, plunging hundreds of thousands into immediate unemployment. Our banks were greatly exposed to the impact of the Crisis, and its effects are already becoming evident across most of the country."
romania.3.a: "This could be bad."
romania.4.t: "Economic Recovery from Black Wednesday"
romania.4.d: "Due to the number of significant programs and reforms done by the government, the Romanian economy has fully recovered from last year's effects of the London Stock Market crash. Our economists have predicted that inflation will be soon under control again and interest rates will be back to normal. Importantly, the average Romanian citizen is now feeling the effects of the recovery; having a sustainable income to purchase stable prices of household goods."
romania.4.a: "Thank God it's over..."
romania.5.t: "Tensions in Translyvania"
romania.5.d: "There are reports of tensions between our security forces and the ethnic Hungarians living in the areas that once owned by Hungary; specifically in the Translyvanian region. With the economic crisis experiencing in Romania; many citizens in the region with Hungarian descent have demonstrated in various government installations; citing that the government didn't do much to help them in this economic crisis. While some of our intelligence overatives say that the [HUN.GetAdjective] is behind on all of this to destabilize the region; it also means that the [ROM.GetAdjective] Government failed to address the needs of its citizens during this difficult times."
romania.5.a: "This is bad..."
romania.6.t: "Railroad Explosion in Transylvania"
romania.6.d: "This morning in Transylvania, many have been awoken by the blast appearing to have come from the railroad installations in the outskirts of the city. While thankfully there are no casualties; the railroad have been under repairs for several hours; hindering the travels of our trains arriving and departing from the region. Many from our intelligence sources have concluded that this is an act by [HUN.GetAdjective]s who are sympathetic to the regime in [HUN.Capital.GetName]."
romania.6.a: "Arrest the conspiritors!"
romania.7.t: "A Possible Coalition?"
romania.7.d: "Since Virgil Madgearu is appointed the 3rd regent of the Kingdom, effectively becoming its new Head of Government or Prime Minister, there are proposals within his party and some prominent officials from PDaT; to consider trying to gain a coalition with the PDaT, a radical republican socialist party operating here in Romania. The possible coalition would in fact strengthen the support of the grip of power of the PSDR if elected; however, it can leave a bad taste in the mouth of some radical right groups opposing socialism."
romania.7.a: "The coalition is created"

### Modifiers
ROM_cut_off_relations: "Removed Diplomatic Relations"

### Leader Descriptions
POLITICS_REGENCY_COUNCIL_ROMANIA_DESC: "The marriage of Carol II to a commoner as allowed Prince Nicholas to assume the role of Regent in his nephew's behalf. However, as the plotted coup against Michael was exposed by officers of the military; other members of the Regency decided to depose Nicholas from his position, replacing him with Constantin Sarateanu. However, Sarateanu's death in October of 1935 has left the position of regent vacant, needing a 3rd regent to be chosen."
POLITICS_NICHOLAS_I_DESC: "Prince Nicholas of Hohenzollern-Sigmaringen, or Prince Nicholas of Romania was born to King Ferdinand I of Romania and Queen Marie of Romania in Sinaia, Romania on the 5th of August, 1903. Much like his nephew, Prince Nicholas was also born within the walls of Peles Castle.\n\nPrince Nicholas of Romania had a career in the British Royal Navy but had to abandon it in order to form the head of the regency council following the death of Ferdinand I. Much like his brother, Carol, Nicholas did not particularly want a political career and was resentful that he was forced to return to Romania. However, his regal and executive duties superseded his desire to stay in the navy. He served as the head of the regency until Carol returned home to rule as king of Romania in 1930. After the return of Carol, Nicholas went into exile in Transylvania, distancing himself from his brother and politics overall.\n\nDespite Nicholas’ lack of initial desire to lead Romania during the regency, he is ready to usurp his inexperienced nephew at a moment’s notice. As the brother of Carol, and much older than Michael, Nicholas arguably has a stronger claim to the throne than his nephew, Michael I. In addition, Nicholas is also driven by the great pride he has for his country. He will do what is necessary to preserve Greater Romania, no matter the cost."
POLITICS_MICHAEL_I_DESC: "Michael was born to Crown Prince Carol and Crown Princess Elena in Sinaia, Romania on the 25th of October, 1921. The young son of Carol and Elena called Peleș Castle his home, in the countryside just outside of Brasov. The beautiful aristocratic estate rests comfortably in the Transylvanian Alps, constructed in 1914 by Carol II. In addition to living in an opulent home, Michael was also given special schooling by Carol, his father. The descendant of Ferdinand I of Romania and King Constantine I of Greece, royal blood runs through Michael’s veins. The houses of Hohenzollern, Saxe-Coburg, and Windsor all swirl around in the blood of the young prince. Undoubtedly, the heir to the Romanian throne was destined for greatness.\n\nJust a teenager, Michael has had little opportunity to lead his country. His father, then Carol II, and his grandfather, Ferdinand I, bickered regarding Carol’s several love affairs. Carol deserted the Romanian Army during the Great War to pursue a love interest and indicated to his father that he wished to abandon his status as heir to the throne of Romania. When he left the country with his new lover, Michael inherited the status of heir, and when Ferdinand died in 1927, Michael inherited the throne of Romania at age 5. Michael was underage, so a Regency Council which included his uncle, Prince Nicholas, stepped in to rule the country. In 1930, Michael was replaced by his returning father and ever since has been cast back into the shadows. On many occasions, Michael was presented with the opportunity to lead, yet could not assume his proper role as king of Romania. Perhaps now is his time to bring stability and pride to the throne of Romania..."
