Founded in Calcutta following a crackdown against radical Gewog leaders, the Congress has done very little since its creation. However, the rise of Subhas Chandra Bose has brought about increased Indian investment into the DNC, intending to use this collection of dissidents to destabilise Bhutan.

BHU_social_democrat_party_long: "Bhutan State Congress (Democrats)\n§gFounded by a handful of Lhotshampa intellectuals, the Bhutan State Congress is a movement attempting to create a Lhotshampa political awakening in the southern regions of Bhutan. They have not found much success in their endeavours, with the oppressed Nepalese minority remaining sceptical of these political idealists, and the ruling authorities quick to stamp out dissent.§!"

BHU_social_liberal_party_long: "Jai Gorkha\n§gFounded in the Indian states bordering southern Bhutan, Jai Gorkha is an underground political movement that aims to create a new state for the Nepalese, called Gorkhaland.

BHU_market_liberal_party: "Radicals"
BHU_market_liberal_party_long: "Druk Gyalpo (Radicals)\n§gThe Radicals are a small group of court officials who are committed to bringing more democratic reform to Bhutan. While they share goals with the Reformist faction in court, they believe that the reforms offered by said faction are too limited and often chafe against Sonam Topgye Dorji's dominant position in that faction. With little support among any of the reigning powers in Bhutan, there is little chance that they will be able to act as anything more than a vocal opposition.§!"

BHU_authoritarian_democrat_party_long: "Druk Gyalpo (Reformers)\n§gThe Reformists are a collection of nobles and court officials who advocate for a series of reforms meant to modernise the Kingdom of Bhutan. While fiercely loyal to the power of the king, they hope to devolve some powers from the aristocracy to the Gewog village elders, while retaining the power of the central monarchy. Their base of power is centred around the king's Gongzim minister, Sonam Topgye Dorji. Through his influence, they have become the second most powerful faction in the country, with the king slowly subscribing to this more reform-minded approach to ruling.§!"

They are supportive of the reigning Druk Gyalpo but seek primarily to expand the power of the Penlops at the expense of the central authorities. The Traditionalists are strictly opposed to the reforms proposed by Sonam Topgye Dorji and his clique of court loyalists, seeing them as a direct affront to feudalism in Bhutan.§!"
