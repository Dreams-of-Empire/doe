bel.1.t: "Belgium after the Great War"
bel.1.d: "In 1914, Germany invaded Belgium, disregarding its neutrality and pulling the United Kingdom in the war on the side of the Entente. Belgian troops were quickly overrun, but were able to entrench behind the Yser river. In occupied Belgium, the Germans pursued the Flamenpolitik, a policy directed towards the Flemish nationalists and essentially giving in to their demands. In free Belgium, King Albert led his troops behind the frontline. After the war ended this gave him a popularity boost. In the 1920 Treaty of Versailles, Belgian diplomats were able to secure territorial claims on Zeeuws-Vlaanderen and Dutch Limburg from the Netherlands. As a result, relations with the Netherlands have never been the same since. \n\nIn the 1919 Pact of Loppem, the King sat together with the Belgian politicians who stayed behind in occupied Belgium and discussed the possibility of universal suffrage for all men above the age of 21. In the next elections, universal suffrage was enacted, effectivily turning the country into a mass democracy. As an effect, several political parties had to reform their programme to attract more voters. New parties fighting for the Flemish cause were also founded and even within the traditional parties the cause was adopted. In the early 1930s this lead to the enactment of several linguistic laws which made Flanders monolingual Dutch in the administration. \n\nHowever in recent years, several far-right and far-left parties have emerged because of a growing disdain for the current political system."

His 35 year old son, Leopold, will now follow in his father's footsteps as King of Belgium."

bel.3.d: "With the death of King Albert only one month ago, Belgium and the royal family have been struck by disaster again. Leopold III and his wife Astrid were involved in a car crash in the Ardennes earlier this day. Leopold survived the accident, but his wife died in his arms. Police officers rushed to the scene and discovered some elements that sabotage may be the cause of the crash. Leopold III is furious and is determined to find the culprit, whatever the cost may be."
bel.3.a: "Start an investigation into the case."
bel.4.t: "Enact Krijgswet to help the investigation?"
bel.4.d: "If parliament were to enact the Krijgswet, the military would take over the investigation into the death of Queen Astrid. This would improve the chances of catching the culprit, but it would mean that he would probably not get a fair trial."
bel.4.a: "The Krijgswet passes in parliament, do everything to catch the killer."
bel.4.b: "The bill fails, a fair trial is too important."
bel.5.t: "The killer is caught"
bel.5.d: "With the enactment of the Krijgswet, the military quickly took over the case of Queen Astrid. Using all their resources, they were able to find the culprit. After a two day long manhunt, they caught a middle-aged man just before he could cross into Luxembourg. The man had ties to a local communist cell. He will now probably dissapear somewhere in a dark jail cell."
bel.5.a: "Those damn anarchists!"
bel.6.t: "Investigation hits dead end"
bel.6.d: "The investigation into the suspicious death of Queen Astrid has hit a dead end. King Leopold III is frustrated because the Krijgswet didn't pass. If it did, surely the killer would have been caught. Tensions between Leopold III and the government are now rising. Throughout the country, more and more people are expressing their sympathy for the King."
bel.6.a: "The nation enters a state of mourning."
bel.7.t: "Election results are in"
bel.7.d: "The results of the latest elections just came in. King Leopold III now has to form a majority government based on the new composition of parliament. The next government will determine the future of the country for the next four years, so the King's choice is of the outmost importance."
bel.7.a: "The King refuses to form a government!"
bel.7.b: "The King starts negotiations"
bel.8.t: "Unrest in Wallonia!"
bel.8.d: "The King's decision to not form a government, rooted in his frustration with the case of his wife's death, has become a major reason for unrest in Wallonia. People are going on strike and in some places they are even attacking police forces. It has come to the point where civil war is a very real possibility. Reports of communist cells taking up arms are already coming in and the army is on high alert."
bel.8.a: "Crush their petty rebellion!"
bel.8.b: "Vive la Révolution (Play as communists)"
bel.8.c: "Parliament deposes Leopold III and declares the Republic before war breaks out."
bel.9.t: "Which coalition should lead the government?"
bel.9.d: "The results of the latest elections were ambiguous, the three traditional parties have lost some popularity and extreme-left and -right parties are on the rise. As a result, the negotiations to form a coalition have taken much longer than expected, but have finally come to an end. A new Prime Minister will soon take the stand in Parliament and declare the new government."
bel.9.a: "A coalition of Catholics and Social Democrats will lead the government"
bel.9.b: "A coalition of Catholics, Market Liberals and Social Liberals will lead the government"
bel.9.c: "Other coalitions have failed and the far-right will lead a minority government"
bel.10.t: "Who will become Prime Minister?"
bel.10.d: "In the new Catholic-Social Democrat government, someone should take the role of Prime Minister. The only question is whether a member of the KP/PC or from the BWP/POB should lead the country."
bel.10.a: "A Social Democrat should be PM"
bel.10.b: "A Catholic should be PM"
bel.11.t: "Who will become Prime Minister?"
bel.11.d: "In the new Catholic-Market Liberal-Social Liberal government, someone should take the role of Prime Minister. The Catholics already gave their support for a liberal, the only question is whether it should be a market liberal from the LP/PL or a social liberal from the PP."
bel.11.a: "A Market Liberal should be PM"
bel.11.b: "A Social Liberal should be PM"
bel.12.t: "Who will become Prime Minister?"
bel.12.d: "With the far-right taking over government after the recent elections, it is a surprise they were even able to form a coalition, as they are now discussing who should be Prime Minister."
bel.12.a: "Staf de Clercq (VNV) should be PM"
bel.12.b: "Joris van Severen (Verdinaso) should be PM"
bel.12.c: "Léon Degrelle (PB) should be PM"
bel.13.t: "King Leopold summons the Prime Minister for an explanation"
bel.13.d: "After the investigation into his wife's death hit a dead end, the King wants an explanation from Prime Minister Paul van Zeeland. Leopold's main complaint is the failing of the Krijgswet in Parliament, as it would have solved the mystery already, if the military had taken over the case. However, Paul van Zeeland refuses to give any explanations, as the information about Queen Astrid's death is confidential."
bel.13.a: "Who does he think he is?"
bel.14.t: "A revivalist Manifesto"
bel.14.d: "A recently published article by Léon Degrelle has caused some controversy lately. In the article, Degrelle describes Belgium as a crosspoint between Germanic and Romance culture in what he calls the Pax Belgica, the peaceful coexistance of both cultures. He argues that this Pax Belgica is what made the region so successful on several occasions in history. He uses the example of the great Empire of Charlemagne and the Duchy of Burgundy, both powerful nations of the Middle-Ages. \n\nLéon Degrelle then went on in describing his plans to participate in the coming elections with his new party, the Parti Bourguignon. His programme consists of what best can be described as Revivalism. He declares his strong aversion towards the monarchy, as for centuries it was a tool used by foreign powers and the Catholic Church to surpress the Germanic and Romance people of Belgium. Degrelle further describes progressive policies he will strive to implement if his party gets elected into office."
bel.14.a: "Ideas like this can only be encouraged"
bel.14.b: "Ban the article from being distributed further"
bel.15.t: "Ultimatum from Belgium"
bel.15.d: "Belgium has sent us an ultimatum demanding the annexation of Luxembourg into Belgium. Luxembourg participated in the Belgian Revolution of 1830 and was part of the country until the Treaty of London in 1839, when it became an independent Grand Duchy. In the following years, Belgium considered Luxembourg as a lost territory. After the Great War, Belgium has tried to renegotiate the status of the 1839 Treaty, including the status of Luxembourg. However, due to Belgium receiving Dutch territory, Luxembourg was left alone. After the revivalist took over in Belgium, new voices which speak of annexation of Luxembourg have risen."
bel.15.a: "Join our Belgian brethren"
bel.15.b: "Refuse to join them"
bel.16.t: "Black Wednesday hits Belgium"
bel.16.d: "Following the stock market crash that hit London just a few days ago, our economy is also feeling the effects of Black Wednesday. Our economy is heavily dependant on trade in the North Sea and investments from both the UK and France. This is yet another example of big powers dragging small countries into their mess."
bel.16.a: "Oh good Lord!"
bel.17.t: "Luxembourg accepts our demands"
bel.17.d: "Luxembourg has agreed to the annexation into Belgium. The government of the small country has looked upon the close ties it has with Belgium and the political situation in Europe and has realised that the safety of its people can only be guaranteed by a bigger and stronger country such as Belgium. Ever since 1839 Belgian politicians have dreamed about the return of Luxembourg into Belgium and now that dream has come true."
bel.17.a: "Eendracht maakt macht - L'unité fait la force - Unity makes strength"
bel.18.t: "Luxembourg refuses our demands"
bel.18.d: "Luxembourg has refused to join our country. Léon Degrelle has already prepared our country for war with its small neighbour. Whatever the Luxembourgians may think of the ultimatum, they will join us, either peacefully or by force. They were stupid enough to think that they can deny us our rightful claims."
bel.18.a: "Then war it is"
bel.19.t: "March on Brussels"
bel.19.d: "Today a large number of people have gathered in Brussels to protest against the recent enactment of the Krijgswet. Most of them identify themselves with the new revivalist movement of Léon Degrelle and call themselves the Bourguignons. However, some Flemish nationalist movements are also present. The question is what their motive is and how the city officials should react."
bel.19.a: "Disperse the crowd with force!"
bel.19.b: "Let them protest peacefully"
bel.20.t: "Investigation into the PM"
bel.20.d: "The King has asked publicly for an investigation into the finances of Prime Minister Paul van Zeeland. The King has become suspicious of van Zeeland after his recent behavior in the Krijgswet vote. Parliament has agreed to start an investigation, but the question remains who will lead the commission."
bel.20.a: "Hendrik de Man will lead the investigation"
bel.20.b: "Paul Hymans will lead the investigation"
bel.21.t: "What's our next step?"
bel.21.d: "What should be our next step in the investigation into Paul van Zeeland? The government wants this handled quickly and put a lot of pressure on the judges involved in this case. It is highly probable that the Commission will get only one judicial request granted. Now the question is whether a house-search should be conducted in the home of the Prime Minister, or if a look into his financial records will give more results."
bel.21.a: "Request a warrant for a house-search"
bel.21.b: "Take a look at his financial records"
bel.22.t: "Investigation hits a dead end"
bel.22.d: "The investigation has hit a dead end and gorvernment officials as well as members of parliament want the inquiry to end sooner than later. As a result, the Commission has been disbanded and Paul van Zeeland remains untouched."
bel.22.a: "He's a lucky man!"
bel.23.t: "PM involved in scandal!"
bel.23.d: "A recent inquiry into the financial affaires of Prime Minister Paul van Zeeland has revealed that van Zeeland has been receiving money from the National Bank on a regular basis. Further investigation pointed out that the money was used illegaly in van Zeeland's campaign for the next elections. Although no official action has been taken, this will greatly affect van Zeeland's political career."
bel.23.a: "Poor Paul, he had it coming"
bel.24.t: "Degrelle calls out van Zeeland"
bel.24.d: "After the recent scandal involving Prime Minister Paul van Zeeland, Léon Degrelle has called out the PM's actions in a public speech. The newspapers further contributed to the affaire and published Degrelle's speech the next day. As a result, the poll numbers of his party are on the rise, while van Zeeland's popularity is dwindling."
bel.24.a: "Degrelle certainly has a special way of making sure he's heard"
bel.25.t: "Invitation to Ghent"
bel.25.d: "The Belgian government have sent us an invitation to Ghent to discuss the unification of our two nations into one bigger state called Dietsland. Of course their ideas are insane and would bring a lot of problems with them. Although some people in our nation would like to see a unification, we as a government can not give in to these absurd ideas and demands."
bel.25.a: "Kindly reject the invitation"
bel.26.t: "The Dutch refused!"
bel.26.d: "The Dutch refused our offer to sign the Pacification of Ghent and unite Dietsland into one nation. This is outrageous, but we were prepared for this display. All over the Netherlands, loyal supporters of the Verdinaso cause are preparing to overthrow the government of Prince Bernhard. These secret agents will attempt to kill Bernhard and establish a new government which will seek unification with us into a greater nation."
bel.26.a: "If Bernhard doesn't support us, we have to get rid of him"
bel.27.t: "Belgian Plot Discovered!"
bel.27.d: "Our secret service has discovered a Belgian plot to overthrow our government and kill Prince Bernhard in an attempt to put Verdinaso at the head of our nation. This Belgian plot is just another example of the growing danger our southern neighbors pose to the Dutch State and Prince Bernhard. Luckily for us, we have identified the majority of the conspirators and our police forces are already on their way to eliminate the threat."
bel.27.a: "Those damn waffle eaters, let's teach them a lesson!"
bel.28.t: "Our coup attempt failed!"
bel.28.d: "Our attempt to establish a loyal government in the Netherlands has failed. The Dutch are preparing for war and so should we. We need to strike them before they strike us. If they don't want to unite Dietsland peacefully, then we have to do it by means of war!"
bel.28.a: "Let's teach those clogs a lesson!"
bel.29.t: "The end of Belgium!"
bel.29.d: "VNV has successfully made an end to Belgium! By giving more and more federal characteristics to Belgium, the country has practicly ceased to exist."
bel.29.a: "Play as Flanders"
bel.29.b: "Play as Wallonia"
bel.30.t: "Congolese Autonomy"
bel.30.d: "The Belgian government has decided to grant Belgian Congo more autonomy. Through regional independence, our colony can contribute more to the welfare and scientific knowledge of Belgium."
bel.30.a: "Continue playing as Belgium"
bel.30.b: "Play as Congo"
bel.31.t: "Hendrik De Man assumes control"
bel.31.d: "Hendrik De Man has assumed control over Belgium. Previously a member of the Belgian social democrats, the actions of the King have lead him to embrace vanguardism. De Man will now push forward his vanguard agenda in hopes of stabilising Belgium."
bel.31.a: "De Man has a plan!"
bel.32.t: "Collectivists remain in control"
bel.32.d: "The National Collectivists of the KPB/PCB remain steadily in control of the new Belgian state. Though their victory in the Revolution, they will bring peace and prosperity to the peoples of Flanders and Wallonia."
bel.32.a: "Long live the Revolution!"

##### Belgisch Centraal-Afrika
bca.1.t: "Belgisch Centraal-Afrika"
bca.1.d: "On 18 October 1908, the Belgian Parliament voted in favour of annexing the Congo as a Belgian colony. After our victory in the Great War the Ruanda-Urundi also fell into our hands. De jure it was a League of Nations mandate, but de facto Belgium had a free hand there. In 1933, Congo and Ruanda-Urundi merged to form Belgian Central Africa. The new African government was given greater autonomy in exchange for one demand: the BCA has until 1939 to prepare for annexation by Belgium. The plan is to 'civilise' and develop the country while making it dependent on Europe until it is ready for integration as a federal region. Will Pierre Ryckman's strategy satisfy the Belgian government?"
bca.1.a: "Time Will Tell"
bcaintro_tt: "§RThe Deadline is January 1939§!"
