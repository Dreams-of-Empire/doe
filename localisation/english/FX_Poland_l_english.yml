### History
POL_FUHRERREDUX_DESC: "Poland was reborn thanks to the Versailles. After more than a century of opression, the Polish people could once again taste freedom. But is this freedom safe? The enemy is on all sides, even inside the country. With revanchist Ukrainians to the east, expansionist Germans to the west and rising internal problems, the country will either fulfill the role of the "abomination of Versailles", or find its way through the new, yet not unfamiliar, surroundings. Will the Kingdom of Poland thrive and lead its people to glory? Or will it get destroyed once again, with its legacy perished in the ashes of modern warfare?"

### Events ###

poland.1.t: "The Kingdom of Poland"
poland.1.d: "Following the Partitions of Poland at the end of the 18th century, Poland regained its independence in November 11th 1919 thanks to the Treaty of Versailles. The Kingdom of Poland is a semi-constitutional monarchy, led by the king Franciszek I Radziwiłł, one of the most prominent Polish magnates. The revitalization of the country's industry and infrastructure, was abruptly halted by the Polish-Ukrainian war, which broke out in 1918. The Poles emerged victorious, holding onto their historical territory of Red Ruthenia. The victory however, wasn't merciful to the territory itself, leaving it utterly destroyed, and with that, problems emerged. As soon as the Marshal of Poland, Józef Piłsudski, retired from politics, and the new government was democratically elected, it was obvious that Polish politics will give the whole country a hard time. Numerous disagreements between, and within the parties, caused gridlocks which paralized the Sejm over and over again, forcing the King to disband it numerous times. The situation only worsened when the Prime Minister Gabriel Narutowicz, after a couple of months in office, was assasinated by a member of the right-wing party, the National Democracy (Narodowa Demokracja). Seeing the innefective polital system collapse under its own weight, in September 1926 Józef Piłsudski came back from his political retirement, and, with the consent of the King, assumed total power over the government and the Sejm. This stabilized the Polish "democracy", and lasted until Piłsudski fell ill in July 1935, and his influence and control over his supporters started fading away. The fights in the Sejm erupted once again, as strong as never before, with several parties splitting due to internal disagreements. The Polish King, for the third time, used his power to disband the government and the Sejm, but this time, only new Sejm elections were organised. Instead of electing a new government, the King appointed a group of advisors, to help him run the country. This state continues to this day, but the change may come any minute now, with Piłsudski's state of health getting only worse, and the Sejm starting to be inneffective as it always was."
poland.1.a: "Pro Fide, Lege et Rege!"
poland.2.t: "The Polish Industry Bill"
poland.2.d: "The last few years Poland's industrial legislation hasn't been updated at all, this has had a negative effect on the Polish people and her economy. To fix this the two parties in the Sejm have each submitted a plan. The MOW wants to lower taxes on consumer goods, and build extra civilian factories. While the PSCD wants to subsudise military factories. Which plan should we choose?"
poland.2.a: "Choose the MOW's plan"
poland.2.b: "Choose the PSCD's plan"
poland.2.c: "Veto the bill alltogether!"
poland.3.t: "The Tax Reform Bill"
poland.3.d: "The Polish tax system is outdated and unnecessary complicated, this lead to massive tax evasion and people being taxed rates higher than 100%. The parties in the Sejm have both submitted a plan to fix this mess. The MOW has a proposal which focuses on a slightly progressive system and the PSCD wants to implement a flat tax. Which one should we choose?"
poland.3.a: "Choose the MOW's plan"
poland.3.b: "Choose the PSCD's plan"
poland.3.c: "Veto the bill alltogether"
poland.4.t: "The freedom of speech Bill"
poland.4.d: "This bill was proposed by the MOW and the PSCD, this plan wants to implement a universal free speech law for all inhabitants of the kingdom of Poland, not just the Poles. This would make Lithuania very happy, but a greater amount of freedom of speech also decreases the status of the monarchy and the monarch. What should we do with the bill?"
poland.4.a: "The Bill passes!"
poland.4.b: "Veto the bill!"
poland.5.t: "Minorities' privileges"
poland.5.d: "For a long time, minorities possesed a number of rights and privileges. On today's discussion in the Sejm, the conservative PSCD party brought up this topic. The question is, what do we do with these rights? The population is split on this matter, and so are the members of the parliament. Should we listen to PSCD and lower their rights, or should we listen to PPS and SL, and either leave them as they are, or increase them further?"
poland.5.a: "Listen to the socialists, More privileges"
poland.5.b: "Listen to the liberals, They have enough of them"
poland.5.c: "Listen to the conservatives, They have too much"
poland.6.t: "The Army Reform Bill"
poland.6.d: "In these turbulent times an improvement of out army is necessary. Two plans have been proposed. The MOW proposes to simply conscript more men in exchange for hiring less researchers, while the PSCD only wants to increase researchers. Which plan should we choose?"
poland.6.a: "Choose the MOW's plan"
poland.6.b: "Choose the PSCD's plan"
poland.6.c: "Veto the bill alltogether"
poland.7.t: "The airforce Reform Bill"
poland.7.d: "The Polish airforce still uses old Great War planes which are not only incredibly outdated, but also incredibly ineffective. The MOW and the PSCD have now both both submitted a plan to fix our airforce, the MOW proposes to focus on the ability of our fighters and the PSCD proposes to focus of our bombing capacty. Which plan should we choose?"
poland.7.a: "Choose the MOW's plan"
poland.7.b: "Choose the PSCD's plan"
poland.7.c: "Veto the bill alltogether"
poland.8.t: "The Great Sitting of the Sejm"
poland.8.d: "Despite the bad situation in the country, the Sejm didnt discuss any problems for months, and this is about time we do something about it. The King has ordered to organise a Great Sitting of the Sejm. Similar to the big Sejm sittings that had been organised in the times of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth, this assembly will take an extraordinary amount of time. Accomodations for all additional guests such as minority representatives are prepared in places nearest to the building of the Sejm, and all needs such as meals will be provided in the Sejm's building. The sessions will begin at 10AM and end at 8PM, with breaks. Every representative that will not appear on any of the sittings will have his seat in the parliament stripped away, as this is a matter of the highest national importance."

poland.11.t: "The democratic elections"
poland.11.d: "The Polish people may vote for a new parliament once again, but this time it is a bit different, it's the first time that more than two parties are on the Ballot. The choices are between the social democratic SPRD, the social liberal party SL, the market liberal party SPR, the social conservative PSCD and the authoritarian democrats MOW."

poland.28.t: "Piłsudski is dead"
poland.28.d: "On today's evening, Piłsudski was found lying dead in his office. The soon-ordered examination of his body revealed a huge internal bleeding, probably caused by a liver cancer which was developing for a long time. In response to the death of one of most influencial and beloved Polish figures, the King has announced a national week of mourning. Piłsudski will be buried next to his mother, on a cementary in Vilnius, with all the honours the greatest commander of Poland shall get. With his death however, come another problems. His popularity among the population was keeping our state together for a long time. But now, with him gone, the parties in the parliament will possibly start to fall apart again, resulting in a disaster we already expierienced two times in the last 5 years. This is why we have to organise a great debate as soon as possible, in order to solve all problems before the whole aparatus of the Sejm's power will again vanish under the parties' disagreements and internal fights."

poland.30.b: "The king should have more power"
poland.30.c: "We should keep it as it is"
poland.31.t: "The question of radicals"
poland.31.d: "The radical parties are posing a major stability risk to our country. A quarter of our population consists of minorities, which, according to radical parties' programs, should be polonised, or even expelled. We cannot let this happen. It is also worth mentioning that a party opposed to us, the PSCD, is planning a coalition with the National Democrats. Banning the ND could possibly help us win the nearest elections. What should we do with them?"
poland.31.a: "We should ban the ONR"
poland.31.b: "We should ban the ONR and the ND"
poland.32.t: "Military demands a share of power"
poland.32.d: "On today's evening, the Marshal of Poland, Edward Rydz-Śmigły, entered the King's office with a clear, yet controversial proposal. On behalf of the Polish Army, he demanded a return of the "General Inspector of the Army" rank. Śmigły stated that it should have the same power it had in the old days of the Polish-Bolshevik war, basically making it the most powerful government rank after the monarch. Although the proposal was presented peacefully, the King's advisors are afraid of an agressive response to a refusal. What should we do?"
poland.32.a: "You can have it..."
poland.32.b: "It is mine!"
poland.33.t: "The military supports the King"
poland.33.d: "Now, with the military's support, the power belongs to the King , and any traitors seeking to change this status will face the wrath of the King's loyal army!"
poland.33.a: "Now...where is my crown..."
poland.34.t: "Military coup!"
poland.34.d: "My King! The military units that were supposedly "training" on the outskirts of Warsaw are now openly hostile and entering the city! The Marshal of Poland, Edward Rydz-Śmigły has stated that "In order to preserve democracy, he is obliged to step in before the King assumes total power". The military has turned against us, and the last loyal units have been arrested or are fightning with the enemy on the streets of Warsaw. However their loyality can't save us. We are heavily outnumbered. This is the end of the monarchy."
poland.34.a: "My King, you are under arrest for crimes against the state"
poland.35.t: "What should we do now?"
poland.35.d: "The state is under our total control. The swift take over of the vital government buildings in all major cities was surprisingly successfull. But now, one question remains. Should we bring back democracy like the Marshal promised in his speech, or should we claim the power for ourselves, and estabilish a military junta?"
poland.35.a: "This is our time to rule"
poland.35.b: "Let's bring back democracy"

poland.37.d: "The unrest caused by the government banning the National Democracy party has risen more than expected. Thousands of Poles all around the country have taken to the streets to protest against the "Unlawful, undemocratic move of the current government". There are only two choices. We step down, or continue our plans. "
poland.37.a: "This was a wrong decision"
poland.37.b: "They won't stop us"
poland.38.t: "The unrest rises even more"
poland.38.d: "Our stance didn't help with resolving the unrest at all. Now there are even more people on the streets, and the police force cannot contain the protests anymore. The previous small skirmishes have turned into literal walls of people pushing towards the police lines and protesters have already started constructing barricades on the streets. We have to step down, or send in the military, or else the situation will completely slip out of our control!"
poland.38.a: "We give up"
poland.38.b: "Send in the military"
poland.39.t: "The railroad workers' strike"
poland.39.d: "The railroad workers supporting the protests have organised a strike! Without functioning railways we cannot transport our troops from other regions to Warsaw to contain the protests, and the city garrison is too small to do anything on its own! Now, only a miracle can save us."
poland.39.a: "Uh-oh"
poland.40.t: "People are marching towards the capital!"
poland.40.d: "The protests were raging all around the country for days now, but we got reports about a nationalist march aimed straight for the capital. There are rumors of Roman Dmowski leading it himself. Meanwhile, all government buildings in Warsaw are sorrounded, and there is no way out. We are encircled, and unable to act. The military is helpless, so we are here on our own. Start the prayers..."

poland.41.a: "The new era starts now!"
poland.42.t: "Formation of paramilitaries in the east"
poland.42.d: "Thanks to our decision during the Great Sitting of the Sejm, which provided a wide spectrum of new rights for the minorities, they have formed paramilitary groups in response to the current situation. Their job, at least according to their leader's - Symon Petliura's words, is to save the current Polish government from "an unlawful revolt staged by nationalist radicals, who seek to destroy the current balance of rights between the nationalities of Poland". According to our informants, these groups are currently marching towards Warsaw, with a clear intention to disperse the nationalist militia."
poland.42.a: "Are we saved?"
poland.43.t: "ND gives up"
poland.43.d: "The Nationalist march, after hearing the news about the eastern paramilitaries marching towards Warsaw, has disbanded and fled the city. The police force has recontained the protests and the government buildings are slowly getting recaptured from the hands of protestors.

There are two parties who still want to cooperate with the "undemocratic and evil" monarch. The Social Liberal SL, which proposes a model of a benevolent dictatorship, which would help the poor and spread the wealth, and the Nationalist ND, which seeks to estabilish a homogenous Polish State, with the minorities sweeped to the margin."

The aim of the meeting is to decide the path for the new military dictatorship. Among many proposals, there are two which stand out, and are possibly the only viable options. Either we estabilish a centrist, benevolent dictatorship, and earn the support of the people through helping them, or we estabilish a nationalist government, with the aim of creating a homogenous Polish State, with the minorities sweeped to the margin, with barely any rights.

Due to the urgent need for bigger imports, the Polish government seeks to expand the port and dockyard infrastructure in the Lithuanian region. However, such an investment is expensive, and the Polish had asked us for help."

poland.57.d: "For ages, Poland had problems with their western nerighbour, Germany. Now, the Polish government has decided to change it, by accepting a plan focused on fortyfing the western Polish border. Of course, such an investment is possible for the Polish, but they will certainly need some expierienced assistants, as they have never built such a thing before. Should we send send some of our fortification specialists to Poland?"

poland.59.d: "Following the estabilishment of the Maritime & Colonial League in Poland, the Polish government started searching for new lands they could gather resources, and prosper from.

poland.63.t: "Polish Fortification Funds"

poland.64.d: "Since the Versailles Conference, Romania and Hungary came to hate each other. Due to the creation of the Republic of Transylvania, and claims of both Romania and Hungary to the region, various diplomatic disputes took place, damaging their relations greatly.

poland.69.a: "Attack!"
poland.70.t: "Poland requests military advisors"
poland.70.d: "With Poland slowly drifting into our sphere of influence and possibly joining our alliance soon, they have asked us for military advisors. It seems that they perceive out military as the greatest army on earth, and we aren't surprised. Should we help them in their army development?"
poland.70.a: "Send the advisors"
poland.70.b: "Not until they join our alliance"
poland.71.t: "Poland requests help in building their eastern fortifications"
poland.71.d: "Knowing the danger of being bordered by the Red Giant, Poland has brougth up a plan to fortify its eastern border. They have enough funds to start the fortifications by themselves, but their efficiency will be bigger if we lend some of our fortification specialists to them."
poland.71.a: "Send the specialists"
poland.71.b: "They stay with us"
poland.72.t: "Polands wants to buy tanks from us"
poland.72.d: "Following the debate in the Polish ministry of defense, the Polish have decided that their army is in an urgent need for new tanks. Due to their membership in the Stahlpakt, they have proposed us an offer. Should we sell them some our tanks?"
poland.72.a: "They should have some of our superior tanks"
poland.72.b: "These are only for us"
poland.73.t: "Poland proposes an arms deal"
poland.73.d: "Today we were visited by a polish diplomat, with an interesting proposal. The Polish High Command have decided that their stockpile of weapons is too small, and debated the issue. Looks like, from various contractors, we were seen as the most appriopiate nation to buy arms from."
poland.73.a: "We accept the deal"
poland.73.b: "We can't spare any guns"
poland.74.t: "Poland requests financial help"
poland.74.d: "The Polish have finally decided to fortify their most vulnerable, western border. They know that their funds won't be enough to build fortifications great enough to stop a German advance into their fatherland, so they have turned to us, and seek financial help. This investment may be useful not only for them, as the finished fortifications will probably stop the Germans in Poland, long before they reach our land."
poland.74.a: "We must help them in stopping the German expansionism"
poland.74.b: "They can do it on their own"
poland.75.t: "Russian SSR refused to help"
poland.75.d: "Sadly, the Russians refused to send us financial help. This means that the fortifications will have to be much smaller, and for sure not as efficient as the ones we had in plans. We will have to suffice with these for now."
poland.75.a: "Let's hope the bunkers will stand against the Germans"
poland.76.t: "Poland wants to join the Internazional"
poland.76.d: "Our fellow Polish socialists have decided to seek protection in our glorious alliance! Should we accept their request to join?" "

poland.77.t: "Bank robbery in Lwów!"
poland.77.d: "Terible news! Under the cover of the night, robbers have broken into one of the subsidaries of the Polish National Bank in Lwów! All deposits, together with the cash that was stored in the bank's vault is gone, and the value of the robbed goods is estimated to be around 13.000.000 złoty! The robbers were profesionals and their action was perfectly coordinated. The police suspects that when one of the robbers waited in the bathroom for the bank to close, the rest was entering the building from the back, by drilling a hole in the wall of the adjacent house. After the bank has closed, the robber who previously was hiding, had incapacitated both guards, and obtained their keys, and later used them for a quick escape through the frontal door. We have to act fast, or the robbers will run away with all the valuables!"
poland.77.a: "Find them!"
poland.78.t: "They have vanished!"
poland.78.d: "Despite the great effort we put into finding any clues, there are literally none. We have searched the whole building, and there isn't even a single sign of their work, except the hole in the wall and opened deposit boxes."
poland.78.a: "How?! Look for something!"
poland.79.t: "Trails found!"
poland.79.d: "We found something! One of the policemen have came across a part of the car which the robbers, supposedly, used to escape. It seems that the driver hit the kerb, and a part of the car's bumper stayed on it. The police suspects that car was a white Opel Olimpia. Now, we just have to look for similar cars."
poland.79.a: "Search in the city!"
poland.79.b: "Search in the suburbs!"
poland.80.t: "Nothing!"
poland.80.d: "None of the Opel's in the city missed a part of their bumper! We are just wasting time looking for cars when the robbers are escaping with our money!"
poland.80.a: "Goddamnit! Search the suburbs! Quick!"
poland.81.t: "Tools & weapons found!"
poland.81.d: "We found more clues! When searching the possible exit-routes from the city, the police patrol found a bag, containing all the tools that could be used to break into a bank, in the same fashion the robbers did. It is possible that we are very close to their hideout. We should concetrate our efforts on that area."
poland.81.a: "We are close!"
poland.82.t: "Mysterious Informator"
poland.82.d: "On today's evening, a bell rang on the Lwów's main police station. The night-shift guard has opened the door, but to his surprise, the only thing outside, was a letter on the welcome mat. He brought this letter to the commandant as fast as he could. Upon opening and reading it, it was already obvious how important this information is. We don't know the source, but somebody just revealed where the robbers are hiding! We need to get there and arrest them before they escape!"
poland.82.a: "Quick! Get them!"
poland.83.t: "Hideout"
poland.83.d: "We have secretly surrounded the robbers' hideout. Scouts claim that they are still inside. All units are ready to storm the house. However, there is a danger that the robbers will try to burn the money they have stolen, and we can't risk to loose it. They are also supposedly heavily armed. Should we try to negotiate?"
poland.83.a: "Let's negotiate"
poland.83.b: "Raid the hideout!"
poland.84.t: "Ultimatum!"
poland.84.d: "In response to our negotiation attempts, the robbers have issued an ultimatum. They demand half of the robbed money for themselves, a car, and a possibility to drive away without the police chasing them. These demands are obviously absurd, but this is the only way we can prevent an unnecessary blood-bath in the hideout and having our money destroyed."
poland.84.a: "We accept it"
poland.84.b: "Their demands are unnaceptable! Prepare the raid!"
poland.85.t: "They are gone!"
poland.85.d: "After accepting the demands, we have withdrawed all units from the house's surroundings. The robbers left the house, entered the car, and drived away. As soon as they left the estate, we have sent a group of police cars after them, but, to their surprise, the cars, and with it, the robbers, vanished. They have tricked us once again. On the bright side, the suspects left the promised half of the money in the house."
poland.85.a: "Again?!"
poland.86.t: "Raid report"
poland.86.d: "A swift police raid was executed. The first unit entered the house from the front through the main door, immediately getting caught in a cross-fire during which 4 policemen were wounded and 2 were killed. The second police unit entered the house through the basement entrance located outside the house, and after forcing their way into the house through the barricaded basement doors, managed to kill one robber without casualities. The other suspect escaped upstairs, where he had locked himself in a room and barricaded it. Before the police managed to break the door down, the suspect burned 3/4 of the robbed money, and set up a "defensive position" using a flipped toppled wardrobe and a table. It took another 2 killed policemen to force him out of there and kill him. This unsucessful action will for sure make it to the tommorow's newspaper headlines."
poland.86.a: "What a failure"
poland.87.t: "Possible hideout found!"
poland.87.d: "Great news! The police patrols have found a possible hideout in the surroundings of a small village near the main road. While we aren't entirely sure if the reports are true, we have already played cat and mouse long enough. It is time to raid their safe spot and get our money back!"
poland.87.a: "Raid it!"
poland.88.t: "Wrong house!"
poland.88.d: "The reports were mistaken! We have raided a house belonging to innocent civilians! The public opinion is thrilled and this will for sure make it to the tommorow's newspaper headlines. This was the biggest embarassment in the whole existance of the Polish Police Force."
poland.88.a: "Who is responsible for this?!"
poland.89.t: "They have escaped!"
poland.89.d: "Today, the police have found a possible hideout of the robbers. It is located in the woods, not far away from one of the main exit-routes from the city. Sadly, it is empty. The robbers are gone, and so is our money."
poland.89.a: "Who is responsible for this?!"

polpeace.1.d: "Poland has gone to war with our northern neighbor Slovakia. It has been clear to most that Slovakia was nothing more than a rump state after the collapse of Czechoslovakia but now these open hostilities between Poland and Slovakia show us that none of the Great powers are interested in maintaining Slovakian sovereignty.

POLITICS_FRANCISZEK_RADZIWILL_DESC: "King Franciszek I Radziwiłł (full name: Janusz Franciszek Ksawery Józef Labre Bronisław Maria Radziwiłł) (Born in Berlin on September 3rd, 1880) is a polish nobleman and a king of the Kingdom of Poland.\n\n During the Great War he found himself on the Russian side of the frontline, in his family estate in Ołyka in Volhynia. There, he organised help for the refugees from the Congress Poland. In 1918, as the supporter of the Regency Council, he came back to Poland and became a member of the Jan Kanty Steczkowski's government as the Director of the State Department. He was responsible for the Polish foreign policy and developing the Polish diplomatic ties around the world.In the summer of 1918 he held diplomatic talks with the German and Austrian emperors, Wilhelm II and Carl I, about the future of the Kingdom of Poland. During the meeting they considered various candidacies for the crown of the Kingdom of Poland. During the meeting he also refused to be a candidate for the crown of the Kingdom of Lithuania, as he was a cousin of the German emperor. In 1919 he tried to become a part of the Polish diplomatic mission to the Conference of Versailles, but failed. Nonetheless, to his surprise, on the Versailles Conference, the Regency Council was proclaimed the only legal government of Poland. Then, on November 20th, he was chosen by the Council to become the new King. It was obvious that the decision was pushed by the Entente Powers, due to Radziwiłł's royal ties to various royal families of europe. One month later, Janusz Radziwiłł was officialy coronated and he chose the second name Franciszek as his royal name. "
POL_Edward_Rydz_Smigly_desc: "Known as Józef Piłsudski's heir, Rydz-Śmigły obtained his fame after his deeds in the Polish-Ukrainian War,halting the Ukrainian advances through methods similiar in manner to those used on the western front during the Great War. Developing a line of defences, he allowed his superior, Piłsudski, to focus on dismantling the encircled Ukrainian troops defending in local areas.\n This experience and other factors led to him choosing well dug-in defence as the conflict-winning tactic."
