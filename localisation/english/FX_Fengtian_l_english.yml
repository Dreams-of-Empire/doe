MAN_FUHRERREDUX_DESC: "With the Anti-Zhili Coaltion being formed in 1924 consisting of the Anhui, Kuomintang, and Fengtian, the war ended disastrously for the Zhili, resulting in a large collapse of the Clique itself. With the Fengtian Clique finally reigning supreme in Beijing, Beiyang had managed to become stable once again with the Zhili remaining a minority in the government. However the relations with the Kuomintang in the south quickly souring, the Northern Expedition against Beiyang began. While the Kuomintang saw initial success, intervention by Shanxi caused their advance to stall, forcing peace between the two biggests governments in China."

#### EVENTS ####

man.1.d: "With the Anti-Zhili Coalition being formed in 1924 consisting of the Anhui, Kuomintang, and Fengtian, the war ended disastrously for the Zhili, resulting in a large collapse of the Clique itself. With the Fengtian Clique finally reigning supreme in Beijing, Beiyang had managed to become stable once again with the Zhili remaining a minority in the government. However the relations with the Kuomintang in the south quickly souring, the Northern Expedition against Beiyang began. While the Kuomintang saw initial success, intervention by Shanxi caused their advance to stall, forcing peace between the two biggest governments in China."

man.2.d: "Over the past several months, the Zhang Council has been working to strengthen Fengtian's economy. These efforts have paid off enormously- Fengtian's economy is better than ever before! While it is still nowhere near an industrial power, it still proves the brilliance of the Zhang Council- the pre-eminent political authority in our state."
man.3.d: "Several socialist associations gathered over the past several days in and around Beijing, our de jure capital, to demonstrate against what they view as an unfair, exploitative, and imperialistic relationship with Japan. While actual violent protest has been rare and sporadic, it is clear that those assembled wish for the current government to be replaced with one similar to those in the socialist states of Russia or Georgia."
man.4.d: "The Concordia Association, the Pan-Asianist and radical political sect, has rioted across the country today! Japanese collaborators clashed with socialist and liberal elements in Tianjin. Several have been left dead and the city paralyzed since. While police squads descended on the riots quickly, many along the eastern countryside have come to see the riots as proof that pro-Japanese popularity is greater than previously imagined..."
man.5.d: "The Concordia Association, filled with a strange mixture of scoundrels and extremists, met today on the border with old Korea. Japanese ambassors crossed and communicated with the higher-ups in the association, but what exactly the conversation entailed is not yet known. What is known is that the Concordia Association has, with this action, clearly dedicated itself to the overthrow of the current state. Who knows what might follow if they succeed."
man.6.d: "Amidst the political turmoil in these past weeks, it is nice to know that many of our people across the country support the Zhang administration. Although the rallies were countrywide, they were centered mostly in Beijing and Hsinking. Many spectators were wowed by the spectacles and speeches given during these speeches. Needless to say, even Zhang Zuolin was taken by surprise, not having personally expected the rally to take place, though he was more than happy to give a speech, which was met with raucous applause."
man.7.d: "Zhang Zuolin was shot dead today by Concordia Assocation goons! While touring the city of Beijing, China's jewel, his entourage was set upon by several Japanese collaborationists- most strangely, Zhang was in the capital that day giving a speech on the warming of relations between Fengtian and Japan in the coming conflict against the Zhili. The collaborators who were still on the scene were shot dead immediately, but Zhang Zuolin had already been declared dead by the time they had been killed. Fengtian descends into a strange interregnum, and without a firm and well-liked head, it is uncertain who will assume power of Manchuria..."
man.8.d: "Zhang Zuolin, our erstwhile leader, was laid to rest today in Hsinking just outside of the old Imperial Palace. Attended by a core loyal staff, including his council, wider ceremonies were held throughout the nation. A deep sense of foreboding now blankets the country, and soldiers grip their guns just a little tighter. There is no telling what might happen next..."
man.9.d: "The Zhang Council today announced the formation of the Chamber of Confidence, comprised mostly of former Council members, but also some prominent economic ministers and presumed-loyal military staff and generals. The purpose of the Chamber is to elect a new leader for the Governancy, though it is difficult to say who exactly they will elect."
man.10.d: "After extensive deliberation, the Chamber of Confidence has come to a compromise- the election of son Zhang Xueliang, 'the Young Marshall', to the position of Head of State. Although he is not very well renowned for his military prowess or political experience, he was one of the only people that most members of the Chamber of Confidence could agree on. It remains to be seen how exactly he will treat this post."
man.11.d: "Zhang Xueliang gave a stirring speech today at his inauguration, declaring that Fengtian would enter this next decade a world superpower. When asked by some members of the press he was willing to entertain how exactly this would be accomplished, he explained simply to reunify the Chinese peoples under one banner and eliminate foreign interest. It is generally assumed that he meant 'Japanese'. Regardless of the foreign implications of this speech, it certainly rallied the public."
man.12.d: "In a shocking turn of events today, several important member of the military, including General Zongchang, demanded Zhang Xueliang turn over power to them! It is difficult to say what exactly the outcome of this will be..."
man.13.d: "In response to aggression by the Head of State against important military figures, a coup was enacted in the de jure capital of Beijing today. The city has been essentially overrun, and the coup threatens to spread to other cities around Fengtian."
man.14.d: "Zhang Xueliang departed from Hsinking today to a family-controlled summer palace in the countryside. In what can only be assumed to be a turning-over of power to the military of Fengtian, the people are rallying to bring him back into power, though, with the military in league and comprising the new government, these demonstrations are bound to fail."
man.15.d: "Most military officers and captains associated with the Beijing coup have been recaptured and are being held until further notice, including the traitorous Zhang Zhongchang and his lackey Zhang Haipeng. There is only one fate for scum such as these."
man.16.d: "Demonstrations countrywide have been going for at least the past few weeks, and only promise to become worse. Republicans, collaborators, and unions all working against our government- what will it mean for Fengtian?"
man.18.d: "The day has been filled with republican demonstrations across the country, as people come to remember the promises of Zhang Zuolin weeks ago. What do we do with them?"
man.19.d: "The day has been filled with union demonstrations opposing what they view as a stranglehold on the people, politically and economically. What do we do with them?"
man.20.d: "The day has been filled with Japanese sympathizers and collaborators, who have been working feverishly to get Fengtian to work alongside the foreign menace! What do we do with them?"
man.22.d: "The demonstrators, vile as they are, have been repressed, and the police and military maintain full control over every part of the country that matters."
man.23.d: "The government has been abandoned, the council nowhere to be found, and the people restless in the cities. Our government isn't really being held together by anything!"
man.24.d: "The military is reeling from the executions just days ago. Two of our top leaders and several of those under them are now dead or imprisoned, and who can say what will happen to them. In times like these, it is necessary to decide the future fate of the military. Zhang Xueliang can either assume direct control, or pursue a policy that will pull men and leaders from all over Fengtian."
man.25.d: "The bases lie empty, and the checkpoints without men to staff them. Are there even police in the stations, or guards walking the streets? Can anyone besides Zhang Xueliang's personal bodyguard protect him? There is no more government in Fengtian, and no one to back it up. When dawn breaks tomorrow, it can be assumed that the Fengtian of years prior will no longer exist."
man.26.d: "The personal cabinet of [Root.GetLeader] has resigned alongside his Council. They apparently plan to return to the localities from which they originated."
man.27.d: "Looting in Beijing is reaching an all-time high today and has been continuing for the past few days. In the midst, Xueliang can no longer be found in the country- though he had been visiting his summer palace. It is assumed he has escaped westward, perhaps into Mongolia or Shanxi, though he has not been found there either."
man.28.d: "Since the collapse of the central government, local rulers have taken precedent over their respective townships, villages, and counties. While Fengtian still exists nominally, it is unsure to what degree these rulers will maintain control against whatever exists of the state or its military."
man.29.d: "Urban cities are collapsing! Rulers in those localities are unable to hold them together, and people flock outward seeking food and weapons. With no central authority to control these people, it is likely that cities will fail to function in a couple months if the state does not return to restore order in some way."
man.30.d: "The pro-Japanese political group 'The Concordia Association', who, in the previous years has been a thorn in the side of the ruling elite, has come to the fore of what remains of Fengtian politics. At the behest and with the support of the Japanese government, the Concordian Association has been able to win peasants and disaffected workers across the rural areas of Fengtian. What success they will have in the urban areas remains to be seen, but their stances are clear- a united China, amiability toward the Japanese, and a Pan-Asian faction to rival any other."
man.31.d: "The Communications Clique, comprised mostly of the old ruling elite and many dozens of the most powerful industrial kingpins in Fengtian, has finally been able to dominate urban politics, a position which they had not held in the past couple decades- not without their trying of course. They promise the people economic freedom, an oligarchic republic, and a free and united China. How many of these promises they could actually deliver on remains to be seen, but it is obvious that their doctrine is gaining popularity among disaffected urbanites."
man.32.d: "In response to the recent decline in the power of any central authorities, the fledgling Interests groups of the Concordia Association and the Communications Clique have banded together to restore order to Manchuria. With wealth and popular support it is supposed that they will be able to succeed, at least for now."
man.33.d: "The liberals and republicans, though taking up a lessening portion of groups vying for political power, still demand attention. Many of their most prominent representatives, such as Tang Shaoyi and Liang Shiyi have been going throughout China, talking about what think are their 'upsides'. Unfortunately, we can't just kill them. However, it has come to the attention of several loyal members of our government that many of those in the liberal and republican movements share shady pasts, dating back in some cases almost as far as the Qing. We can either allow them to keep demonstrating or use this knowledge to... teach them a lesson in dealing with our government. If the populace were to gain wind of that development, however..."
man.34.d: "The instability of these past few months has prompted a response from the Japanese government! They demand that we submit to them. When we responded asking whether this meant politically, economically, militarily or a combination of the three, they responded that that remained to be seen. While this proposal is not yet public to the wider world, there's no way it won't be exposed soon. There's really only one option..."
man.35.d: "The instability of these past few months has prompted a response from the Japanese government! They demand that we submit to them. When we responded asking whether this meant politically, economically, militarily or a combination of the three, they responded that that remained to be seen. They additionally revealed something else- they know that we blackmailed several republican figureheads! They have threatened us- our own personal blackmail. Of course, this junta is more stable than it has ever been, and we can be confident that the people stand behind us!"
man.36.d: "The government of Japan has handed licenses to several of its prominent companies, equating to an allowance of Japanese interests to enter Fengtian and compete with domestic businesses. There's no competition over who would win those markets. The people will not appreciate this..."
man.37.d: "The Japanese have met our refusal! Several pamphlets and dossiers have been reproduced and sent to several media outlets in the country. Although the army is currently conducting an investigation and crackdown, it's no secret that the general populace already knows everything there is to know. While the republicans and liberals are being held up as martyrs, it's clear that the greatest political influence of this event will be whatever happens next to our government. It almost certianly won't hold, and it's only a matter of time before the army and police join the protestors already congregating, as they seem to be doing very often these days, in major cities nationwide."
man.38.d: "The Japanese government has come out to announce its Co-Prosperity Doctrine which outlines a co-habitated East Asia. It doesn't not take much reading between the lines to see that they wish to considers themselves the hegemon of that new continent. The public has been outraged by the recent turn of events, but every Japanese ambassador has been proclaiming the equality between our countries, and that this is not a military takeover. The truth of this fact hasn't disuaded the strongest Chinese nationalists in our country from coming out and speaking against the decision."
man.39.d: "In Beijing today, our controversial leader [Root.GetLeader] declared the persual of a One-China Policy, and gave a speech on the hardships waged against the Chinese people for the past century. Promising a return to an agrarian and independent past, [Root.GetLeader] expounded on the newfound collaboration with the Japanese, and declared them a tool rather than a threat. The speech has drawn great ire from many, but this having been his first gallant public appearance in months has allowed many to galvanize around him and bolster his popularity."
man.40.d: "Despite the precarious position the Fengtian military has found itself in, Zhang Xueliang's guidance and countrywide doctrine has allowed it to continue functioning normally. It is expected that, in the coming weeks, all problems once associated with the military that have been brought upon it will be smoothed over or forgotten about."
man.41.d: "The title of 'President of the Republic of China' has been a precarious one for many decades, as it is a title which typically brings bad luck upon those who take up its mantle. Many previous people who declared themselves as such have been ousted in less than savory ways. Now, too, it carries an extra weight- with the Kuomintang government to the south, which also believes itself to be the rightful successor of China's first republic, it has become a challenge. Through this act, which was broadcast throughout the nation, it is clear that Xueliang has become either brave enough or arrogant enough to assume he can overtake all complications associated with the title's history."
man.42.d: "Apparently the Japanese are going to send a personal diplomatic message in the next few days. It must be rather important for them to send a pre-proposal statement."
man.43.d: "We just received a telegram from the Japanese! They demand that, with the death of Zhang Zuolin, we submit to them, like a dog! They claim something about instablity and an ineffectual rule, but they clearly didn't hear Xueliang's broadcast. He's the President, Chief Councillor, and Grand Marshall of Fengtian. They are obviously uninformed. How should we respond?"
man.44.d: "Japan made an official statement today, following our rebuke of their tripe, declaring their observance of Fengtian sovereignty."
man.45.d: "[Root.GetLeader] has assured the people of the Japanese's good intentions. We will see exactly what this will mean for Fengtian..."
man.46.d: "Japanese business has now started across the border, coming from Joseon into the eastern portion of Fengtian. What will this mean for the future of Fengtian?"
man.47.d: "Fengtian stands alone upon China, one state against those who would wish to impede it. The future looks bleak and bright at the same time, and it will only be through what is of Zhang Xueliang's cunning as Marshall that will determine whether Fengtian becomes the dominant Chinese power or another small page in the annals of history..."
man.48.d: "Zhang Zuolin has brought in the past years a list of new freedoms to Fengtian. In the most recent while, however, he has made allusions toward a republic, though exactly what form it would take is uncertain. Memories of the Republic of China still permeate the culture of every Chinese state, and it has led to a sort of unrest among the liberals and republicans who have made a resurgance in that past few years. It is now that Zhang Zuolin is at a political impass and it is unsure exactly what path he will take..."
man.49.d: "In response to the increasing efforts of disparate political groups within Fengtian, Zhang Zuolin will come to Beijing to tour the nominal capital for the next several days and give speeches to the masses of Manchuria. Radio broadcasters worldwide are expected to come in to observe one of the most important political events of the last few years in China. The outcome of these speeches remains to be seen, however."
man.50.d: "The raiders which have 'settled' our nothern provinces in Heilungkiang have attacked local infrastructure today, and made off with a significant amount of cargo and prisoners, which will likely find their way into the circulation of coastal black markets. If we do not stop them soon, these attacks may come to pass again!"
man.51.d: "Our government recently pursued a policy of public works, something which has been sorely lacking since the esablishment of [root.GetName] itself. We have a choice now to choose our next project. The next will become available to us once we have collected enough dues to do it again."
man.60.d: "Our government recently pursued a policy of public works, something which has been sorely lacking since the esablishment of [root.GetName] itself. We have a choice now to choose our next project. The next will become available to us once we have collected enough dues to do it again."
man.52.d: "[root.GetName] has long been a multiethnic state, and this has caused some problems, with each ethnic group attempting to advocate for their own. While this has typically been an argument had between Han and Manchu Chinese, some other groups find themselves at odds. An answer, [root.getLeader] has said, may be to officially recognize one culture. We must consider though- which one?"
man.53.d: "The Manchurian People's Association, a socialist conglomerate of unions which has long petitioned for an end to our state, are now to be called for what they have said. The leaders of the Railway Union, composed of almost all rail workers in the country, have been summoned to Hsinking. They will function as the delegates for the political association itself. Now we must demand of them what will be done."
man.54.d: "The raiders of Heilungkiang have agreed, somewhat tentatively, to our contract. We will pay them in produced goods, and they wil no longer raid our economic infrastructure."
man.55.d: "The Manchurians have sent their pigdog raiders into our border provinces to steal our resources and damage our factories! Reports are coming in that they have also stolen machinery from our factories. Before local militias and other armed groups could respond, they escaped back across the border. It became clear, then, that they are operating in tandem with the Manchurian army."
man.56.d: "Our hired raiders have come back over the border with minimal casualties carrying an immense about of wealth! We have taken our cut, and one thing is clear: This endeavor was almost certainly worth it."
man.57.d: "The raiders are gone, now, but we need to ensure that we never have to see them again. The people disagree with our actions, but they will surely be much happier knowing these degenerates are raiding anywhere else."
man.58.d: "The raiders who have struck our industry time and time again, but most seriously in early 1936, are now in our sites, and our military has assembled for some days over the hills of some targeted encampments. We can now strike!"
man.59.d: "The raids of a few months ago have officially paid back in full, as recent reports on the output of the Heilungkiang industrial complex can attest. Manchuria is now almost comparable to a second-rate Western power!"
man.601.d: "The past few months of turmoil have ended! The army is now ready to be improved, and our top military officers have been called together to discuss it, along with whatever air marshalls and naval captains we can gather around Beijing."
man.62.d: "The government has been abandoned, the council nowhere to be found, and the people restless in the cities. Our government isn't really being held together by anything!"
man.63.d: "Our government, which had been built on the assumption that the Japanese were going to support us after the death of our erstwhile leader Zhang Zuolin, has been proven wrong yet again. The Japanese, apparently playing some kind of extremely complex political game of Go, have decided this, of all times, would represent an excellent time to support the Zhili instead! This has lead to terrible riots and violence in the last few days as the people of this country come to believe they have been betrayed yet again!"
man.64.d: "Japan betrayed us. But now, [root.GetLeader] stands astride, tarnished but unbroken, and proclaims that Asia, once and always, is the domain of China. He has declared in a speech today that Fengtian, now and forever, is the true Chinese force."
man.65.d: "It is clear that the country, in its current state, is no longer fit to go on. So as the sun set on the Fengtian Clique, now too will it set on the [root.GetName]. Some betrayals are deeply remembered by the people. This is one such instance."
man.66.d: "Fengtian and its ruthless government have gone on the path of conquest, and it appears they've come to us for the undeveloped but tactically important province of Suiyuan. Will we give it to them, however?"
man.68.d: "A debate has raged in the Senate over the last several days concerning what must happen to the police apparatus left stranded in the streets of our largest cities! Once loyal to the Zhangs themselves, many police and protection officers have turned to a life of violent crime, since the government has struggled to expropriate the money such officers are due. Who, then, should these officers serve- our people, or all Asia?"
man.69.d: "The Communications Clique has determined our government to follow the old state apparatus, on which they would likely sit comfotably, while the Concordia Association has advocated for those members of the army who service corruption to be imprisoned- or worse. Both of these options would likely damage our stability even more..."
man.70.d: "The Republic of China, effectively devolved into several mutually hostile states and one very hostile military dictatorship to the south, is a sore thought in the memories of the Manchurian people, moreso the Manchus than the Hans, since it foolishly led to the end of a Manchu-led dynasty. Our government hasn't really had to take a stance on what they believe of the Republic, but with Zuolin ousted, and a Senate installed now attempting to elect a head of state, we can use amongst those loyal that we are ourselves the successor to the Republic of China itself."
man.71.d: "Our government, which has been between different factions over the past few months, has finally come to hold its elections! Now it has become clear who will win, and how..."
man.73.d: "The Senate, which had been silently working behind the scenes in Fengtian for some time, has officially adjourned today, after the voting not so long ago. Now they only have to decide which laws need passing..."
man.74.d: "A fight broke out in the Senate today! Members from different sides of the isle, including, strangest of most, those few members of the Research Clique and Republican Party, concerning a democratic reform. Several of the dozens of senators were injured. It is difficult to say exactly who started it, but it is clear that the party of [root.GetLeader] is the one that ended it."
man.75.d: "Republican Party members, dissatisfied with the progress of the oligarchic Communications Clique, have organized against them with the support of the minority Concordia Association and Research Cliques. The bill passed just yesterday completely overhauled the processes which will elect Senators, with guidelines that directly called into question the election of most Communications members. The Concordia Association was affected too, but they stand to gain most from this bill. At least, that's what they hope..."
man.76.d: "The Research Clique, along with other minority Senate groups, most notably the Communications Clique and Republican Party, passed a law today prohibiting the financial support of Senators from foreign states, consequently ousting most members of the Concordia Association from the Senate. A massive fight broke out as army members loyal to the Research Clique came in and forcefully removed several Concordia Association senators who did not cooperate. This scuffle lead to the death of two soldiers and three senators, representing the first case a senator has died since the adjournment of the Senate itself."
man.77.d: "Republican senators, who just weeks ago assisted in ousting Communications members, have demanded that several Concordia Association members step down from their own posts! It is believed that they wish to take majority in the Senate!"
man.78.d: "The Research Clique, responsible for ousting Concordia senators just weeks ago, demanded a place in our governing coalition! They are attempting to usurp the Senate's process and dominate our policy-making process!"
man.100.d: "The leader of the Concordia Association in the Senate, Cao Rulin, has today vacated his seat, and in essence the entire government of Fengtian. While some Manchurian media speculates that this means Japan will come to leave our state alone, it is still clear that this is but a brief break in the imperial ambitions of the Empire."
man.79.d: "Tang Shaoyi, the elderly leader of the Communications Clique, has stated both health defecits and political instability has reasons he has, today, vacated his position as leader of the Communications Clique in the Senate. This is likely dangerous for the Communications Clique's political prospects for a very long time to come. What brought them to their knees in the first Republic may do the same in this one as well..."
man.80.d: "Republicanism was a topic of great discussion not so long ago, but our leader made his own informed decision. Now with the dangers of the near past dealt with, we must deal with this topic once and for all."
man.81.d: "The Elections of [GetYear] have arrived! As far as can be seen, nothing uncouth has occured at any places where voting is taking place, though [root.GetLeader] has given many speeches from Beijing stating that he is confident the people will support him over the Market League. Only time will tell..."
man.82.d: "Manchuria is quite an unstable nation. In the future, it will have to decide to §Grally for§! or §Ragainst§! Japanese support. The Zhili, however, will attempt to do the same. Our oldest foe seems determined to undo us with their help. In addition, many events and focuses will clearly state if they affect our influence with Japan, and how. The higher our influence, the greater chance we will be supported by the Japanese- but certain choices can save that relation or sever it as well. In a couple months, we will have a choice to choose between three possible futures- consult the focus tree to figure out how far and down and how close you are to one of them!"
man.83.d: "The Manchurians, ever the needy sort, have requested that we give them economic stimulus to aid them in their future endeavors. This would be especially useful if we were ever to take them as a subject..."
man.84.d: "The Japanese, apparently turning over a new political leaf, have agreed to subsidize our waxing and waning economy with their very own stimulus!"
man.85.d: "The Japanese, ever the vile serpents, have refused our request for economic stimulus. How will we make them dependent on us now?"
man.86.d: "The Army of Fengtian seems to be weak- and they've come to us for help. While it is risky putting guns in the hands of potential enemies, it would be especially useful to us if both states came to a tactical arrangement."
man.87.d: "Our army, currently languishing after the chaos of a few months ago, is sure to be reviltalized- the Japanese have accepted our request to give loans to our arms factories."
man.88.d: "Our army, currently languishing after the chaos of a few months ago, will have to seek other way to bring itself back to the strength it once had. The Japanese have refused our request!"
man.89.d: "Fengtian has requested that we aid them in their industrial exploits, which will certainly come in handy if our nations can come to an agreement. But only then."
man.107.d: "The Japanese, who we thought would not sink any lower, have today announced their refusal of our request for economic support."
man.90.d: "The warlords have long gone slinking through the proverbial long grass and encouraging corruption throughout our state. It's about time they actually assisted us!"
man.91.d: "Fengtian, a powerful warlord state in northern China, has asked us to assist them in the battle against an imperial Japan attempting to eliminate them. And, of course, they will offer us money."
man.92.d: "The Americans have supported us against Japan! We will have to see where this goes..."
man.93.d: "The Americans have refused our request for weapons! We even offered them our damn money! We will need to find another way to defeat the Japanese..."
man.94.d: "The Chinese have sent us fresh leases on our factories for the guns we gave them. Luckily, with our own, of course, superior economic system, we have minimized and maximized aspects of these factories, which should provide us more resources than the Manchurians are losing."
man.95.d: "The Fengtian Clique have requested that we support them against Japan! Should the Japanese attack them, they say, we should go to war against Japan as well!"
man.96.d: "The Americans will support us against Japan!"
man.97.d: "The Americans will not support us- now what?"
man.98.d: "The Japanese have come into Hsinking and are extracting economic leases and grants for the works they have created for us."
man.99.d: "The Manchurians have offered us their leases and factory grants to pay for the factories we built for them. They profit, frankly, since these leases are only temporary, while their factories last forever!"
man.101.d: "Our diplomats and industrialists have gone out into the world, to those most successful democracies. What is our takeaway?"
man.102.d: "We will offer leases and grants to the Japanese as repayment for their servies to us in the past weeks and months. It is the only moral thing to do. And perhaps the only thing that will keep them happy."
man.103.d: "The Japanese have come into Hsinking and are extracting economic leases and grants for the works they have created for us."
man.104.d: "Fengtian has asked for our assistance in their war against the Zhili! They claim that this war is more than a petty squabble, but a fight for the future of China itself."
man.105.d: "The Zhili shall tremble in their rotten boots at the sight of our regiments pouring down the hills into the border provinces of Shandong! We will take from them what we are rightfully owed, and make great boons in the process. We will lose some men, but so will they, so it works our to be in our favor in the end."
man.106.d: "The vile Fengtian soldiers of the north have launched a minor offensive into Shandong, raiding and killing in the process. The state itself has suffered large losses. While they lost some men as well, this will not be their last foray into our lands- no, this is just a warning shot!"
