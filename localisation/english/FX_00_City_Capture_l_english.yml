capture.1.t: "The [FROM.GetAdjective] Capture of Paris"
capture.1.d: "[This.GetNewspaperHeader]Reports from Paris confirm that the [FROM.FROM.GetAdjective] capital has been captured by advancing [FROM.GetAdjective] troops after furious fighting across its large avenues and the Seine. [FROM.FROM.GetAdjective] forces put up stiff resistance, hoping to delay the [FROM.GetAdjective] forces for as long as possible, but were eventually beaten back.\n\nAs shocked Parisians looked on, the [FROM.GetAdjective] army paraded through the Champs-Elysées and towards the Eiffel Tower. This festive atmosphere eventually devolved into vicious urban combat, however, with [FROM.FROM.GetAdjective] resistance in the dead of the night and [FROM.GetAdjective] force easily ploughing through inefficient barricades in the large Parisian avenues."
capture.1.d.ger: "[This.GetNewspaperHeader]As the sun rose on Paris, German artillery rained upon the city. Unorganized French militias quickly scrambled for their weapons, hardly even awake. German troops stormed the city, taking the industrial areas and hospitals and destroying French barracks with short and deadly firefights occurring around the city. Before the French backup could arrive from the near city of Versailles, most of the city was already under German occupation, and Le Jardin de Luxembourg has been temporarily turned into a POW camp. While there are still small fights happening on the outskirts of the city, it is effectively under German control."
capture.1.d.eng: "[This.GetNewspaperHeader]Paris, the capital and cultural center of France has today been captured by British soldiers. They had quickly moved in on the outskirts and with artillery fire combined with bomber planes, they were able to disorient the French and destroy much of the key buildings of the French army. Then they moved into the city. The French fought hard against the British, but they couldn;t stand a chance being somewhat undersupplied due to having lost most of their equipment and food to the bombing, they had to retreat. And though not all of the metropolis has been occupied yet, and some resistance fighters have already taken up arms, the Union Jack now flies over the Eiffel Tower."
capture.1.d.sov: "[This.GetNewspaperHeader]The day began normally for Parisians, actually, a bit too normal. They couldn't hear any artillery fire or the song of war like they usually do, it was a bit strange. But they shrugged it off as a ceasefire or something like that. Just as they got their days started, they heard screaming. A lot of it. They looked to see he Red Army storming the city as fighters and bombers took up the entire sky. Paris was in disarray, and the soldiers were unable to fight to their full potential as artillery, bombs, and gunfire rained upon them. The city was effectively captured. And the Soviets finally made it to Paris, beating out Tsar Alexander. The area under the Arc De Triomphe has been turned into a temporary hospital for sounded soldiers and a POW cam along the road that it leads out of. The Red banner flies before the capital of France."
capture.1.a: "No! We cannot let Paris fall once again!"
capture.1.b: "France's future is now in question"

capture.2.t: "The [From.GetAdjective] Capture of Berlin"
capture.2.d: "[This.GetNewspaperHeader]Reports from Berlin confirm that the [FROM.FROM.GetAdjective] city has been captured by advancing [FROM.GetAdjective] troops after long, merciless fighting through the greatest city of the Stahlpakt. [FROM.FROM.GetAdjective] forces put up stiff resistance, hoping to delay the [FROM.GetAdjective] forces for as long as possible, but were eventually beaten back.\n\nAs shocked Berliners looked on, the [FROM.GetAdjective] army paraded down the Brandenburg Gate, before listening to a speech by [FROM.GetLeader] in front of the famous monument. However, what eventually seems to have caught the attention and memory of the world is a picture of a [FROM.GetAdjective] soldier proudly holding the [FROM.GetAdjective] flag from the roof of a heavily damaged Reichstag, taken by one of his squad mates."
capture.2.d.eng: "[This.GetNewspaperHeader]The British Government announced today that Imperial forces had entered the German capital city of Berlin. Berliners looked on in shock as British troops marched through the streets. It is said that Union Jacks can already be seen flying high above the Reichstag and Brandenburg Gate.\n\nAs the fighting continues throughout the rest of Germany, it is unlikely that the German Government will hold on for much longer. The vanguard of Valkism looks to be on the edge of capitulation."
capture.2.a: "This cannot be! How can Berlin have fallen?!"
capture.2.b: "Once more the German's are on the cusp of defeat"
capture.2.b.fra: "Verdun, Chemin des Dames, Somme. They have all been avenged."

capture.3.d: "[This.GetNewspaperHeader]Today, a general commanding [FROM.GetAdjective] forces secured the surrender of the Eternal City. For days beforehand, [FROM.GetAdjective] troops had fought through the suburbs, and while some of the swampy areas were still under [FROM.FROM.GetAdjective] control, the major highway through the centre of Rome and the Vatican city was completely locked down.\n\n[FROM.FROM.GetAdjective] soldiers have been seen dispersing into the low foothills surrounding the ancient capital of the Roman Empire.\n\n[FROM.GetNameDefCap] has been careful to announce that special military police are on hand in the city to prevent the looting of Saint Peter's Basicilica and the Pantheon, and they are in negotiation with the Pope to see what autonomy the Vatican can retain while under [FROM.GetAdjective] occupation."
capture.3.d.eng: "[This.GetNewspaperHeader]It is being reported today that the Italian capital of Rome has formally surrendered to British forces. Throughout the city fights are still occurring though, as the British Army seeks to push out any remaining Italian resistance. The Italian Government have been safely evacuated, and the British have agreed to allow the Pope to continue his residency.\n\nWith their largest city in enemy hands, the Italians seem set to collapse soon enough."

capture.4.d: "[This.GetNewspaperHeader]The [FROM.GetAdjective] army has advanced towards and captured the symbolic capital of the United States, Washington D.C. They stormed the Capitol building and met strong resistance, but eventually they broke through and the flag of [FROM.GetNameDef] now flies over the U.S. Capitol.\n\nThis has led to a major crackdown on the government officials there, with mass arrests reported and even rumours of summary executions in the Capitol itself, although unconfirmed sources claim that most important Federal government figures were evacuated during the battle, with their current whereabouts unknown."
capture.4.d.eng: "[This.GetNewspaperHeader]Today, it was confirmed by the British Government that Imperial forces had occupied the American capital of Washington D.C. They stated that - although capturing the city was a great success - it is unknown how much longer it will be before a now seemingly inevitable American collapse. Rumours continue to swirl of a brutal ransack of the city with the White House once more being put to the torch in a repeat of what occurred during the War of 1812.\n\nBritish plans for US occupation are unknown to the world at large. What is known however, is that should the United States surrender then the British Empire will have crushed perhaps one of its most powerful rivals."
capture.4.a: "We won't give up our struggle for liberty and freedom!"
capture.4.b.eng: "And burn that wretched White House to the ground for good this time!"

[FROM.FROM.GetAdjective] forces put up stiff resistance, hoping to delay the [FROM.GetAdjective] forces for as long as possible, but were eventually beaten back.\n\nFor the first time since 1216, London has fallen to a foreign invader. The atmosphere in the city is heavy, with gunfire still ringing out in the night as the [FROM.FROM.GetAdjective] forces retreat, leaving protesters and [FROM.GetAdjective] military police fighting in the streets."
capture.5.a: "This is only a temporary setback!"
capture.5.b: "This is the beginning of the end."

capture.6.d: "[This.GetNewspaperHeader]As the \"Venice of the North\", Amsterdam has long been admired for its beautiful canals and port; the city's \"golden age\" of finance and trade may be long gone, but the city remains a timeless European treasure of prosperity and the arts. Unfortunately, Amsterdam has now become a battlefield, with refugees fleeing to all directions, and it has been reported that after fierce engagement, the [FROM.FROM.GetAdjective] defenders have declared Amsterdam as an open city, following a successful campaign from the [FROM.GetAdjective] forces.\n\nAs fighting in the city ceases and [FROM.GetAdjective] forces have begun marching down the Muntplein - the future is grim for the inhabitants of Amsterdam."

[FROM.FROM.GetAdjective] forces put up stiff resistance, hoping to delay the [FROM.GetAdjective] forces for as long as possible, but were eventually beaten back.\n\nThere were reports of long urban fights through the Gothic Quarter of Barcelona, and sparse fighting along the Barcelonian Riviera. This same Riviera was the site of a long and luxurious parade by [FROM.GetAdjective] troops as they marched along the sunny beaches, a clear symbol that [FROM.GetNameDef] has taken control of the Catalonian city."
capture.7.a: "This is not good..."
capture.7.b: "Barcelona is finally ours!"
capture.7.c: "So falls the heart of old Catalonia."

capture.8.t: "The [From.GetAdjective] Capture of Bucharest"
capture.8.d: "[This.GetNewspaperHeader]Two decades have passed since Bucharest was occupied during the Great War, and now it has once again fallen into enemy hands. Despite the [FROM.FROM.GetAdjective] army's spirited defence, [FROM.GetAdjective] troops have forced their way through. The ageing forts around the city were reactivated to provide some relief to the capital, but it was no use. The Armenian and Jewish Quarters and the Uranus area still offer resistance, the latter aided by the presence of the Metropolitanate and Arsenal Hills. Yet, with the major arteries of Calea Victoriei, Queen Elisabeta Boulevard and Serban Voda Way captured, their fall is all but certain.\nThe residents dread what the occupation may bring, with the last one still in living memory, despite [FROM.GetAdjective] attempts to assuage local concerns. While [FROM.FROM.GetLeader] has pledged to fight on, the future of [FROM.FROM.GetNameDef] is uncertain."

capture.9.d: "[This.GetNewspaperHeader]The [FROM.GetAdjective] capture of Constantinople was completed today, as the last of the [FROM.FROM.GetAdjective] forces were pushed beyond the shores of Bosporus. The capture of the city was relatively swift, and compared to previous sacks of Constantinople merciful. However, many historical sites were still damaged, in particular the Dolmabahce, which was badly damaged by fighting during a final stand of [FROM.FROM.GetAdjective] troops.\n\nThe [FROM.GetAdjective] troops are now patrolling the streets of the ancient city, and the government of [FROM.GetNameDef] has declared their intent of governing the city with as light a touch as possible."
capture.9.a: "We have lost the straits, for now."
capture.9.b: "Constantine's city is ours!"
capture.9.c: "The Bosporus has a new master."

capture.10.d: "[This.GetNewspaperHeader]Today, multiple reports from Ireland confirm that the city of Dublin has been captured by [FROM.GetAdjective] forces. As enemy forces advanced on the city centre, elements of the [FROM.FROM.GetAdjective] military made futile attempts to hold key buildings, culminating in their last stand on O'Connell Street attempting to hold the General Post Office until they were overwhelmed by repeated attacks from [FROM.GetAdjective] troops.\n\nWhile much of the [FROM.FROM.GetAdjective] civilian and military leadership managed to evacuate to the countryside, vowing to continue the fight against [FROM.GetNameDef], their cause has been dealt a severe blow."

[FROM.FROM.GetAdjective] forces put up stiff resistance, hoping to delay the [FROM.GetAdjective] invaders for as long as possible, but were eventually beaten back.\n\nWhile the capture of Gibraltar itself was swift, skirmishes in the tunnels running through the Rock lasted until late in the evening, until the encircled and desperate [FROM.FROM.GetAdjective] garrison announced its formal surrender."

capture.12.d: "[This.GetNewspaperHeader]Bad news for [FROM.FROM.GetNameDef] today as the [FROM.GetAdjective] army has just completed its assault upon the ancient capital. While initial reports suggested the [FROM.FROM.GetAdjective] defenders would be able to hold them at the bridges in a protracted siege, the many avenues over the river proved too much to hold. With [FROM.GetAdjective] troops on either side of the river and scattered defenders surrendering on the isles, Kiev has fallen to the invaders.\n\nWith the thriving hub now in [FROM.GetAdjective] hands, the rest of [FROM.FROM.GetAdjective] lands are in jeopardy. While [FROM.GetNameDef] has promised to respect the 700 years of history built up since the Mongols destroyed it in 1204, Kievan memory is long. Invasions have never been kind to them, and they fear the worst."

[FROM.FROM.GetAdjective] defenders initially held back the [FROM.GetAdjective] army across the Neva River, but a few days ago those positions fell. Now, sustained cannon fire on Vasilyevsky Island has put the last defenders out of their misery. Some military tacticians say that, with proper defence, the city could have held out for years, but the [FROM.GetAdjective] momentum carried them through the city faster than that.\n\nThe [FROM.GetAdjective] army's soldiers are using the Palace Square as a staging ground for moving throughout the rest of the city, and there are rumours of [FROM.GetAdjective] soldiers taking tours through the Museum of Artillery, confident they will put their mark on the history of [FROM.FROM.GetNameDef]."

However, history repeats itself, and once again, Minsk finds herself a frontline of war once again - only this time she is occupied by [FROM.GetAdjective] forces.\n\nMuch of the city has been damaged by intense bombing and shelling, and reports indicate a considerable degree of refugees fleeing from the chaos, despite offering staunch resistance, the [FROM.FROM.GetAdjective] defenders have ultimately offered their unconditional surrender to the victorious [FROM.GetAdjective] forces and only time will tell how difficult the reconstruction for Minsk will be."

Not so today, when [FROM.GetAdjective] forces broke through the siege lines in multiple places and converged on the Kremlin. [FROM.FROM.GetAdjective] soldiers continue to snipe the enemy from high-rises, but the main defences have broken and are filtering out through the suburbs into the surrounding forest.\n\nRed square, long the centre of [FROM.FROM.GetAdjective] life in the city, has been turned into a makeshift POW camp, and burning debris was seen falling from the Kremlin windows, no doubt a last ditch effort to prevent [FROM.FROM.GetAdjective] intelligence from falling into [FROM.GetAdjective] hands.

Under the reign of Prince Regent Luitpold, the city saw an explosion of artistic and cultural activity.\nHowever, the city has come under siege in the recent conflict and, after an exhausting battle, the [FROM.FROM.GetAdjective] forces have evacuated the city. Much of the city lies in ruins, with the Marienplatz lying in rubble, and the domes of the Frauenkirche are heavily damaged as a result of intense bombing. The last of the [FROM.FROM.GetAdjective] resistance in the city's heart at the New Town Hall has finally surrendered to the victorious [FROM.GetAdjective] army.

The ensuring battle saw much of the city destroyed with the Marinplatz lying in ruins while the domes of the Frauenkirche were heavily damaged as a result of intense bombing.

capture.17.d: "[This.GetNewspaperHeader]The city of Narodnigrad has been an important center of transportation and commercial activity for centuries due to its location. Despite explosive population growth, the city's poor conditions had turned it into a hotbed of revolutionary activity. During the Russian Civil War, the town became the site of an important battle and siege, and likewise, history repeats itself once more, as the city has once again become a battlefield.\n\nLarge parts of the city lay in ruins as bitter urban warfare, and aerial bombardments have reduced much of the urban centers into ruin.

There was hope after the Weltkrieg of renewal but, alas, fate has not been kind, as the [FROM.FROM.GetAdjective] army collapsed trying to defend the city from both sides of the Vistula river from advancing [FROM.GetAdjective] forces.\n\nIn a bitter twist to old memories, the Royal Castle in Warsaw has been plundered again by [FROM.FROM.GetAdjective] soldiers before they fled the city, according to [FROM.GetNameDef].

In the ensuing battle, firefights took place along the famous Alameda avenue.\n[FROM.GetAdjective] soldiers were able to smash through the [FROM.FROM.GetAdjective] barricades and fortifications on the Paseo Ahumada.

Surrounded on all sides and with their only escape being the sea, the [FROM.FROM.GetAdjective] made a desperate defence. However, with their supplies being limited and morale low, the [FROM.FROM.GetAdjective] defenders had no choice but to offer their unconditional surrender to the victorious [FROM.GetAdjective] army.

While the port of Cape Town sustained damage during the battle, it will no doubt serve to fulfil the strategic needs of the [FROM.GetAdjective] army as they begin their occupation of the city."
