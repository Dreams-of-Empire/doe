### History
BOL_FUHRERREDUX_DESC: "History hasn't been kind to Bolivia. Struggling as its neighbours took away the little advantages it had, Bolivia has been almost perpetually in decline geopolitically. Turned numb by the repeated failures, the people of Bolivia have suffered a lot and done all they can to go forwards. A chance came during the Chaco War, when they almost defeat Paraguay in a brutal war. However, this chance of redemption was taken away by the Argentinian intervention, and now the Bolivian people can't stand this anymore. The Republic of Bolivia has to die, so the Bolivian people can rise."

bol.3.t: "The Status of Bolivia"
bol.3.d: "It was more than one hundred years ago when the colonists and mestizos serving under the Spanish Empire were tired of the elite's abusive rule over them, and initiated the Oruro Rebellion. Once more, that rebellious spirit is heard within the hearts of every Bolivian. It was less than a year ago that success and redemption were so close to our grasp during the Chaco War, until outside forces robbed us from our chance at victory, as well as our southern provinces, and our nation keeps being tortured by misfortune to the embarrasment to all of South America. Our people has given everything they can and yet we have failed them. Is there yet hope for peace and trust to be born yet again in Bolivia? Or are we finally on our last leg?"
bol.3.a: "Nothing good can come out of this..."

bol.1.t: "The Revolution in Bolivia"
bol.1.d: "It was no mystery to anyone the failures of our government to our people. We have lost externally and internally, Argentina has robbed us of our victory in the Chaco War, while workers are unpaid or unemployed, and everyone can see we are on our lowest point. Today, the bolivian people said no more.\n The streets of La Paz are red, as the international workers' movement known as socialism has taken to guide the misfortuned and poor majority to a better path, no more room for the elite and their own interests! Today, Bolivia is for the common man! A new Bolivia, were every person, no matter their origin, can finally be equal! It seems the revolution, has finally arrived."
bol.1.a: "Workers of Bolivia, and soon, the world, unite!"
bol.1.b: "No! It can't just end like this, we have to stop them!"

bol.2.t: "The Revolution Succeeds"
bol.2.d: "The struggle was hard, but it was worth every moment, each century of suffering under the bourgouise dictatorship. But that injustice is no more. The revolution has triumphed today! As much as the elite wanted to treat us as playthings, as objects of profit and not as human beings, they have falled today, the old order is gone!. Rise up, Bolivia, Rise up, workers! Bolivia is the heart of south america, it is no surprise it is the heart of revolution, too. No longer will unequality and misery torment us, as the people, united, will be the victors!\n A new regime, a coalition of different ideological socialists under the titular leadership of charismatic activist Carlos Salazar Mostajo has been established, promising a new era for workers in Bolivia."
bol.2.a: "Today, Bolivia, Tomorrow, the world. The revolution won't be stopped!"

bol.4.a: "Cower before us, South America, your true rulers have returned!"
bol.4.t: "The Revolution... Failed?"
bol.4.d: "Long was the struggle, many were the revolutionaries that we fought against, and now red are the streets, but Bolivia isn't nor will be red, as the old order succeeds! Or so we though. The fight left us unprepared, and swift they came, large in numbers, chanting in their unknown tongue, and they tore us apart. The red may have fallen today, but so have the colonials, the old elite. The indigenous peoples of Bolivia, united under a common banner have finally risen, they stood on and endured as the spaniards came, and treated them as less, and they stood on and endured as Bolivia got independence and they got the same treatment, no rights, nothing. Well now the tables are turned, and the invaders have to go now! The Caciques of Bolivia have risen, under the head of Santos Marka T'ula, and no colonial devil is allowed in our lands, we were here first, and we will be the last ones here!"

bol.9.t: "Socialists Supported by Bolivia!"
bol.9.d: "Radical Socialists and other left parties like Partido Comunista have recently become very active in Chile's political order, creating a disturbation in what order our society had. All evidence seems to point towards Bolivia funding these extremist groups, we can't just let them do that."
bol.9.a: "Why are we letting Bolivia still stand?"
  
bol.10.t: "APRA Supported by Bolivia!"
bol.10.d: "The APRA extremists that have influenced our nation or tried to do so so much during these late years have recetly taken a peak to their activities, people demostrating on street in their support have increased. A close investigation seems to reveal that the vanguardists across our border are funding APRA's political campaigning."
bol.10.a: "We can't abide to external agents influencing our internal politics."

bol.11.d: "Diplomats from the Workers' Republic of Bolivia have come to contact us. Ever since the Chaco War a few years ago the relationship between our countries has been heavily strained, now however, more than ever, we have been pushed into requiring each other's cooperation, given our new socialist outlook. "Us the proletariat must unite against the bourgouise" they say. While we can't help but to agree, there is something they insist on. Their southern province of Tarija has been on our hands for a while, and we can't cooperate as long as it clouds our diplomatic outlook with Bolivia. Should we give it back?"
bol.11.t: "A Compromise with Bolivia?"
bol.11.a: "Conflicts created by the bourgouise can't keep the workers apart, let's give Tarija back."
bol.11.b: "Noble workers and men from Argentina fought for it, alas, it is a pity we can't work together."

bol.12.t: "Argentina refuses to cooperate"
bol.12.d: "The diplomats have came back. Argentina has foolishly declined to cede our core province back, clearly, nationalistic aspirations in their government must be clouding what could be a pillar for the workers of South America."
bol.12.a: "If Argentina isn't standing for the workers, we are, and we need that Tarija back."
bol.12.b: "I guess we must stand alone for the proletariat, at least for now."

bol.15.t: "An Alliance with Bolivia?"
bol.15.d: "Our bolivian comrades have brought a proposal to us. Uniting forces to defend the workers from reactionaries that try to stomp the revolution and that are still abusing the workers in their own countries. An interesting proposal, this seems to naturally flow into our plans."
bol.15.a: "Today a new stage of the Revolution begins in South America."
bol.15.b: "This may not be the wisest decision."

bol.16.t: "Death of Marka T'ula"
bol.16.d: "Grief has struck us as our beloved and wise guide, the chieftain and general Santos Marka T'ula has passed away in his sleep and found dead this morning. He lived a long life fighting for the rights of those that had them taken away. The natives of this continent, of Wuliwya.\n\nAs we mourn this loss, the political structure of our nation doesn't rest, as the young and popular Eduardo Nina Quispe has risen to take the leadership of the nation, promising change and a strengthening of our nation."
bol.16.a: "We must go on."

bol.17.t: "Eduardo Nina Quispe declared P'iqichiri"
bol.17.d: "As the suyu has felt the need for a strong leader, like only wise Marka was, charismatic Eduardo Nina has found himself rise to the occassion, proclaming himself, our "P'iqichiri", or leader, as we call him. As part of his leadership, he proposes further centralizing the power of the suyu, to be better at directing our nation into a path of success at glory, as well as bringing progress while still keeping traditions in mind."
bol.17.a: "Chamachaña!"

bol.19.t: "The Workers Congress of 1940"
bol.19.d: "Four years have passed since the revolution reached Bolivia, as we have settled in and defended the revolution, in this time, new ideas have been born and the direction of our union is now being discussed. As such a congress where the workers' will be able to discuss Bolivia's path has been called. The future of socialism in Bolivia is to be decided now."
bol.19.a: "For and by the workers!"

bol.20.t: "The Factions in the Congress"
bol.20.d: "As workers from all over the country arrive, three main factions have been formed that the workers identify with.\n\nFirst, prominent revolutionary Tristán Marof has accumulated a sizable following, as he defends the principles of permanent revolution, and the use of a central state as a tool to maintain and spread this revolution, which would actively guide Bolivia in following socialist principles for and by the workers. Policies like further industrialization and militarization follow from this faction's ideology.\n\nOn the other hand, the more moderate workers have reunited around Dr. José Antonio Arze, who proposes a collectivist system where the state leads the implementation of socialism, while still keeping the worker councils important as a democratic political structure to further the workers' will.\n\nFinally, the republic's current chairman, Carlos Mostajo, has formed a new political faction separate from the ruling coalition as he wishes to keep power and implement radical new reforms, granting local autonomy and more directly democratic politics that he states, are closer to the true principles of socialism."
bol.20.a: "The Congress picks Marof as the new chairman. (Vanguardism)"
bol.20.b: "The Congress picks Arze as the new chairman. (Collectivism)"
bol.20.c: "The Congress picks Mostajo to keep his position. (Libertarian Socialism)"

bol.30.t: "Festivities in Tiwanaku for New Year"
bol.30.d: "As our people begin re-embracing our old traditions, now free from the grasp of the colonials, the old celebrations that had to be hidden for so long are now open and for everyone to see.\n\nThe most prominent being new year, now celebrated in the winter solstice, in the end of June, as according to our traditions, we reunite in the old ruins of Tiwanaku. While we all stood in a circle, the amautas – Aymara shamans – built a bonfire and made offerings, such as a dried llama fetus, for good health and fortune. They call upon the Pachamama and Pachakama to bless us, and we thank the sun as sunrise comes."
bol.30.a: "The Sun blesses the Suyu once more!"

bol.40.t: "New Cycle of Revolution"
bol.40.d: "Honoured and esteemed Chairman Marof has just made a new announcement, as part of his reforms, our country, the workers, we have reached a new peak in our journey towards the marxist paradise. However, as the years have passed, the revolution has settled in, and many workers have been losing the revolutionary spirit that brought us together to begin with.\n\nThus a new age of revolution has to start. As the people's army marches through the streets, under the guidance of the Chairman, we will bring the revolution to every citizen once again, and to the whole world!\n\nReactions are split, and many of the political opposition have shown concern."
bol.40.a: "For better or for worse."
bol.40.b: "Long live the revolution!"

bol.41.t: "Political Opposition Arrested"
bol.41.d: "As the state policing agencies increase their size and activity, suddenly the arrest of prominent members of the opposition to Marof's government has happened. The charges? Treason. It seems the opposition and their plans to do away with Marof's reforms haven't been taken easily, rather instead being a betrayal of the revolution, and the workers."
bol.41.a: "Traitors aren't allowed here."
bol.41.b: "This is wrong."

bol.42.t: "Celebrations as revolution is commemorated"
bol.42.d: ""We have come very far. The workers struggled for too long, the people suffered the abuse of the elite, yet we have come to this. Today, we can look at each other with equality, with solidarity, recognizing our brothers, the bonds we share. Together, we made this happen, we founded this new republic, this socialist union of workers that is leading us towards the Marxism paradise, and we won't ever stop!"\n\nThe crowds cheered on after Chairman Arze's speech. We truly have achieved great things."
bol.42.a: "It's nice to do good."

bol.43.t: "The birth of the Commune"
bol.43.d: "Socialism is spread in every bit of our society, but it hasn't been imposed. It has been shared and accepted with peace and solidarity. So claimed Chairman Mostajo in his speech.\n\nWe established this republic as a mean to an end. To socialism and the common good. We have found good success in the way, but it isn't enough, change has to be made. Thus, today we are declaring the birth of the Commune of Bolivia! Where workers can rule themselves in autonomy and equality, without having to be disturbed by a intermediary state, and socialism will be driven from the bottom up!"
bol.43.a: "For the workers!"
bol.50.t: "Bolivia seizes Acre!"
bol.50.d: "Taking advantage of the situation we find ourselves at, the extremist indigenist regime that rules Bolivia has decided, in a show of aggression, to militarily seize Acre, sending its troops to annex the undefended zone, and exploiting the civil war.\n\nA direct act of invasion against our country, sadly we might have to back down from responding at least them control it for now, as opening an additional front in our current situation is a bad idea."
bol.50.a: "Let them have it, for now."
bol.50.b: "We can't let this happen."
bol.51.t: "Help from the Bolivian Proletariat"
bol.51.d: "A show of solidarity, the workers of Bolivia have united and decided to send help to their fellow comrades, us.\n\nWhatever supplies they have sent, this is truly a show of the bonds that hold the proletariat together, beyond borders."
bol.51.a: "Very nice!"

bol.100.t: "The Fate of Chile"
bol.100.d: "As victory came into our rightful hands, we still have decisions to take. Now that Chile is firmly under our control, we have to decide our occupation policy. Most councils approve that we rule directly the rightful Aymara shores of Atacama while granting the southern half of the country to the Mapuche, who having a history of rebellion against the colonials could make worthy allies and have claims as rightful owners of that land. Others however, believe South America must be directly ruled from our state, and not kept divided as the europeans split us. A minority, still, seems willing to keep the Chilean government as their own matters, but firmly under our grasp."
bol.100.a: "Retake our rightful land and Liberate the Mapuche as allies."
bol.100.b: "Retake our rightful land and Keep a chilean government in charge."
bol.100.c: "We must govern the land directly."

bol.101.t: "The Fate of Chile"
bol.101.d: "Red flags waved as our army entered Santiago. The Chilean proletariat has every reason to celebrate, as the bourgouise has been taken care of and they are finally free to embrace the Revolution. Still, we must be careful in deciding the outcome of this war, will Chile remain its own for the workers' to decide, or will the revolution be more directly enforced?."
bol.101.a: "Liberate a socialist state in Chile."
bol.101.b: "Direct rule would benefit the international revolution better."

bol.102.t: "The Fate of Paraguay"
bol.102.d: "As expected, the Paraguayans couldn't stand the might of our warriors and they felt to our grasp. Now, it is time to decide what to do with them. Notable as they are, the Guarani have long stood under the colonial boot while preserving their traditions and memories. It is only fair to give them a chance to redeem themselves as our allies, free from colonial grasp. However, the opportunity to further expand our directly ruled lands is certainly attractive."
bol.102.a: "Establish a Guarani State as a friendly government."
bol.102.b: "Paraguay's current state of affairs isn't so bad, keep their government."
bol.102.c: "Direct rule from Chuqi Yapu to Paraguay."

bol.103.t: "The Fate of Paraguay"
bol.103.d: "The red mobs marched as our army entered Asunción. The workers of Paraguay have every reason to celebrate, as the bourgouise has been taken care of and they are finally free to embrace the Revolution.

BOL_BCW_gambits: "Influencing the Brazilian Civil War"
BOL_BCW_gambits_desc: "Brazil, the South America giant, is torn into pieces as its internal struggles have divided its nation into warring sides. Now all of South America is in a period of instability, and only those who are proactive will come out victorious from this situation. Will Bolivia be part of that group?"
BOL_seize_acre: "Seize Acre"
BOL_seize_acre_desc: "Long ago lost, a sell forced by Brazilian pressure, the land of Acre is a fundamental piece of the Amazons, the beautiful South American jungle, and should be ruled by its true native owners. Now, Brazil is divided, and they won't be able to react if we seize Acre back. Whoever lives there would be grateful to be freed from the marxist yoke, anyways."
BOL_help_brunion: "Support the Union of Brazil"
BOL_help_brunion_desc: "Brave Comrades in Brazil have risen against the oligarchy, but are under attack by reactionary forces. We must support the rightful rulers of Brazil, the workers, sending them weapons for their fight."
