### History
COL_FUHRERREDUX_DESC: "Political instability altered the political order in Colombia in the early thirties, and the Failure in the Peru-Colombian War altered the social one. Now, the old "democratic" order, and the domination of the old parties, has collapsed. Leading a union of populist and nationalistic movements, the charismatic leader Gaitán has risen and listened to the whims of the Colombian people. While a lot of instability remains after the recent takeover, now as the clouds in Colombian society seem to clear, the Colombian people will set their sights on their target, revenge."

col.1.t: "The Status of Colombia"
col.1.d: "For decades the Conservatives have held political hegemony in Colombia, supported by consistent and reliable economic success, albeit amidst social issues that continued to shape the political landscape. Following the Conservative victory in the 1930 elections, the Liberal Party collapsed as the internal disputes between the more moderate and the radical wings of the party grew too vast. While this shook the political environment with the creation of new parties, Conservative control continue to prevail. That is, until the failure of the Leticia War. The entire nation was put to shame in defeat against Peru, losing our southern territories and being forced to pay straining reparations; reparations that hurt the little man, not the political oligarchy.\n\nA wave of revanchist and insurrectionary sentiment came to the Colombian people. Jorge Gaitán, a radical populist politician, known for his extreme proposals to solve the social issues and move Colombia forward, grew increasingly popular as nationalist rhetoric crept into his discourse. Thus, it was no surprise when, in 1935, he, rallying his supporters, marched through Bogotá and seized power, following a highly disputed and questionable referendum. Now our nation is in chaos, but luckily, we have just the man to handle it in charge. Or so we hope."
col.1.a: "Colombia will rise again."
col.2.t: "The Trust of the Army"
col.2.d: "After the defeat in the Leticia War, many eyes have been on the Army's performance. Our people gave everything they had to support them, and many joined the Army to fight for our nation. The Army gave everything it could. Thus, the blame quickly shifted back to the Conservative government.\n\nWhen Gaitán took over, many weren't sure if the Army would intervene, or if it would react at all. But the truth is, the army had lost all respect for the previous government, and welcomed the new president with open arms."
col.2.a: "Together, we'll make Colombia Great."
col.3.t: "The Seas and the Skies"
col.3.d: "When the war came, we found ourselves ill-prepared on the naval and aerial fronts. The navy proper did not exist as a war force, and the air force was young and small. We quickly took the chance to buy a new fleet to fight for us, and with the help of the SCADTA, the German-Colombian Air Transport Society, we were able to arrange a small air force that fought bravely for us. Now we find ourselves wisened up, and knowing we must better prepare for the future."
col.3.a: "Colombia needs a complete force."
col.4.t: "Opposition members flee"
col.4.d: "While we have done what we can to calm the chaos of these last few months, many have begun vocally opposing the government of president Gaitán. Luckily for us, this rebellious activity has fallen away in recent days.\n\nHowever, an explanation to their origins has come to light. It seems that thousands of opponents have being fleeing our borders, fleeing into Ecuador, Brazil, and Venezuela, as well as overseas. While not having to deal with them is nice, it is certainly not ideal to have traitors abandoning our national project and spreading lies about our government."
col.4.a: "Let them go."
col.4.b: "Block their escape."
col.5.t: "Opposition takes to the streets"
col.5.d: "Since we have kept the militant opposition within our borders, many have taken to the streets protesting against what they call 'presidential tyranny'. They clearly haven't even considered becoming part of the greater project President Gaitán has planned. We must be wise when handling this."
col.5.a: "Use force."
col.5.b: "Tolerate the Demonstrators."
col.6.t: "The Demonstrations Persist"
col.6.d: "The use of force against the protestors didn't help. Their militancy has increased to match our own, and they continue to manifest protest after protest against our government. Now President Gaitán has taken to rally the supporters of the government into standing with him against the opposition, preparing a speech for this day. \n\nChaos continued to reign in the streets when Gaitán began his speech from the Presidential Palace. Yet as the cheers of the crowd drowned out those of the protestors, a man armed with a gun approaches the stands..."
col.6.a: "Gaitán rallies the people, and the opposition is driven off."
col.6.b: "Gaitán is shot, wounding him lethally."
col.7.t: "Out of the Chaos"
col.7.d: "The last few months have been some of the hardest for our nation. However, united and with the leadership of Gaitán, we have been able to overcome ever obstacle in our path so far. While it won't be easy, we believe in a greater destiny for the Colombian people, and we will do what it takes to achieve it!"
col.7.a: "Glory for Colombia!"
col.8.t: "A Change in the Order"
col.8.d: "The crowd was shocked, mass rallies in support of the UNCR and against the opposition began, as well as violence filling the streets.\n\\nAs the militant opposition showed its true colors, it seems the more extreme members of the UNCR were in the right. Thus was proclaimed by the leader of the extreme nationalist faction, former Conservative politician Laureano Goméz, exclaimed he will do whatever it takes to crush the traitors and avenge the death of president Gaitán. It seems a change in government has occurred, and the opposition will regret their actions."
col.8.a: "Patria o Muerte!"
col.10.t: "Rally in support of reforms"
col.10.d: "As the reforms proposed by the Colón Platform are implemented, our people are finally feeling their issues dealt with. This has produced a wave of support for our regime. It seems people finally understand how much we care for them."
col.10.a: "Excellent News!"
col.11.t: "Traditionalists oppose regime"
col.11.d: "As we go further implementing our reforms, trouble has been stirred up as the more traditionalist of our supporters have decided they don't agree to our all-encompassing reforms, denouncing them as reminiscent of marxism. They don't seem to understand this is the only defense our nation has against marxism."
col.11.a: "This isn't ideal"
col.12.t: "Investors flee the country"
col.12.d: "As part of our wide financial reforms, the nationalization and protectionist programs seem to have sadly scared off many potential investors. While this may hurt us in the short run, being able to run by ourselves will eventually benefit us, we hope."
col.12.a: "We didn't like them anyways."
col.13.t: "A greater project"
col.13.d: "As the people of our great nation, Colombia, rejoice in their newfound status, cared for by a state that truly is run for and by the people, we find ourselves with greater aspirations.\n\nToo much of South America is containing its full potential under similar luck to the one with had to deal with, so announced president Gaitán in a speech. It seems he has greater plans for us..."
col.13.a: "Where will we go from here?"
col.14.t: "Opposition reacts to national media"
col.14.d: "As the regime has set on focusing their all efforts on strengthening the nation as a whole rather than solving the underlying social issues, both marxists and "democratic" groups have shown their displeasement at this situation.\n\nThis has extended to demonstrations against us."
col.14.a: "Send our forces in."
col.14.b: "We'll show them results."
col.15.t: "Stronger religious policies pushed"
col.15.d: "As we integrate ourselves with Los Leopardos, their reactionary religious policies have called our attention. Certainly a country united by faith forms a stronger nation.\n\nHowever, doing this will quite anger a fraction of our society. Should we?"
col.15.a: "Enact the policies."
col.15.b: "Let's act smarter."
col.16.t: "Economic policy works"
col.16.d: "Months after we adopted the corporatist economic policy, it seems our industrial capacity and our production has noticeably increased. As this information is spread, it seems people will have no choice but to realize we were right."
col.16.a: "Finally."
col.17.t: "Our Birthright"
col.17.d: "Since our birth centuries ago, we were destined for great things. We were destined to free ourselves from our colonial shackles. We were destined to receive great people and adopt their strengths as ours, growing into a diverse yet noble nation. We were destined to become the shining beacon of glory in this continent. We are destined for more, as the world is yet to see what will be of Colombia!\n\nSo was proclaimed as our leader Laureano Gómez decided to set his policies with one goal. Making Colombia the Greatest."
col.17.a: "Nice."
col.18.t: "Colombia Stops Payments"
col.18.d: "In a quite obviously populist move, and with wide disregard for international treaties, Colombia has announced it will stop paying the reparations that they are obliged to by the Treaty of Leticia.\n\nWhile at this point this shouldn't have an impact in our economy we can't deal with, this disregard for our previously established peace treaty can only mean trouble in the long run."
col.18.a: "Damn those Colombians!"
col.50.t: "Ultimatum from Colombia"
col.50.d: "The expansionist government from Colombia has set its eyes on our sovereign nation, as a way of fulfilling their national ambitions and hiding their own internal weakness. Nonetheless, their army has grown and they are prepared for conflict. As such they have given us an ultimatum. Submit to the supremacy of their nation, or face the consequences in the battlefield.\n\nWill we submit to these aggressors or defend our nation?"
col.50.a: "We will never surrended our nation!"
col.50.b: "Our hands are tied."
col.51.t: "The Fall of our Nation"
col.51.d: "As the Colombian invaders advance on the fronts, our men have fought bravely, nonetheless, we haven't been able to push the Colombians back, and now the control over our nation has fallen, under the boot of the Colombian Army. While we can continue to fight, our people are tired and our men and supplies depleted, and it seems like our fate is sealed. Let's try and put an end to this pointless bloodbath."
col.51.a: "We surrender."
col.51.b: "We haven't fallen yet!"
col.52.t: "The Gran Colombian Victory"
col.52.d: "It seems Bolivar's dream of an united Grenadine nation has come true, as the fall of the weak Venezuelans has arrived, and the victory of our people has made us great. Now, as the Gran Colombian nation is reunited, we must we smart handling these newly integrated territories, as many dissidents and enemies reside in them.\n\nFor now, we can focus on stability, and control indirectly Venezuela, giving them autonomy that will reward us with their loyalty, and focus on integrating them later. Or we can annex their provinces to our nation directly, although this may mean having to handle more than a few discontent men."
col.52.a: "Occupy border territories and establish a puppet."
col.52.b: "Annex them all to our land."
col.52.c: "A subject Venezuela."
col.53.t: "Chaos as we fall"
col.53.d: "As much as we have prepared for this, greatness was at hand, however, it seems fate has betrayed us, and given the undeserving Venezuelans the upper hand.\n\nNow our country is in chaos and people are marching for peace. Traitors! They are all traitors!\nNonetheless, the may be about to bring our downfall, and our only chance now may be surrendering and hoping for peace."
col.53.a: "We'll never surrender!"
col.53.b: "We have no choice."
col.54.t: "The Colombian Surrender"
col.54.d: "May it be the case? Has peace finally returned to the continent?\n\nThat's unlikely, however, for us at least, peace is at hand, as the Colombians have finally handed in their surrender. It is now our time to choose their fate."
col.54.a: "Accept the peace, with some land concessions."
col.54.b: "Take the peace."
col.54.c: "We won't accept surrender."
col.55.t: "The Fall of our Nation"
col.55.d: "As the Colombian troops continue increasing their controller territories, our government's control over the country has fallen, chaos on the streets follows as our nation is not able to withstand anymore. Yet, we can't quite give up now."
col.55.a: "We have no choice."
col.55.b: "Peru won't fall today!"
col.56.t: "Victory in the Second Leticia War"
col.56.d: "As our men marched forth with bravery, defeating anyone standing in their way, Perú finally felt the might of the united Colombian nation making them crumble. As such, they had no choice but to surrender. Our men march in victory in Lima, as our flags wave in their cities, signaling the arrival of the victors, the Colombian people.\n\nNow, it is finally time to decide what to do with the spoils of our victory, and how it will be handled."
col.56.a: "Take what we deserve and setup a subject government."
col.56.b: "We will rule everything."
col.57.t: "Chaos as we fall"
col.57.d: "As much as we have prepared for this, greatness was at hand, however, it seems fate has betrayed us, and given the undeserving Venezuelans the upper hand.\n\nNow our country is in chaos and people are marching for peace. Traitors! They are all traitors!\nNonetheless, the may be about to bring our downfall, and our only chance now may be surrendering and hoping for peace."
col.57.a: "We'll never surrender!"
col.57.b: "We have no choice."
col.58.t: "The Colombian Surrender"
col.58.d: "May it be the case? Has peace finally returned to the continent?\n\nThat's unlikely, however, for us at least, peace is at hand, as the vile Colombian scum that threatened our stability have finally handed in their surrender. Peruvian soldiers once again march proudly on Bogotá, as we expect this time, the Colombians finally learn the lesson. It is now our time to choose their fate."
col.58.a: "Take some final land concessions."
col.58.b: "New economic reparations are at order."
col.58.c: "Let's bring a new government, closer to our sphere."

col.60.t: "The Invasion of the Amazon"
col.60.d: "As the Brazilian people is disunited, threatened by traitors and oligarchs that have weakened their unity, we can't help but notice the marxist enemy in our vicinity, the collectivist Union of Brazil. The time is right, as we realize that it may be the best, for us and South America, if we take the chance to invade the collectivists in the Amazons, and reduce their control of the zone, as well as recovering long-lost Grenadine territory, of course."
col.60.a: "For Colombia!"
col.61.t: "The expansionist Colombians invade"
col.61.d: "Just what we needed. The nationalist Colombians, driven by desires of expansion, have exploited our disunity and decided to invade us. As we see them advancing at our back, several brave men have risen to fight for the Union, putting even ideological differences aside as the Brazilian workers stand united against this foreign menace."
col.61.a: "We will hold them back!"
col.62.t: "Victory in the Amazons?"
col.62.d: "Our fronlines and advances have occupied important territories of the Amazons; important for us, at least. Now, as the Union is tired, and as our men celebrate on the front and at home, it seems we will be able to annex these territories to our national domains. Still, some hope that we mantain this war to properly destroy the marxists, but everything seems to point for the war to slow down and cause unneeded losses if we continue."
col.62.a: "Send a peace offer."
col.62.b: "Down with the Marxists!"
col.63.t: "A peace offer?"
col.63.d: "As the Colombians hold on to our outer Amazonian lands, it seems like we can't help but comply to their demands, as they send a peace offer, as just the existence of the Colombian front has weakened our forces too much in our internal conflicts."
col.63.a: "Accept the offer."
col.63.b: "Decline unpolitely."
col.64.t: "Brazilians decline unpolitely"
col.64.d: "Our president seemed taken aback as he received the news of the Marxist Brazilians not only rejecting our generous peace offer, but also sending a rather vulgar insult in portuguese, referencing the president's mother. This behavior won't be answered with nice words, but rather with continued war!"
col.64.a: "Maltditos Brazileños!"

col.1001.t: "Proper Expanse of Our Nation"
col.1001.d: "War, diplomacy, it's all a game. Through whichever means, we have come to control great expanses of land. Some of which, are not integral parts of our nation, not are inteded to be so. It has come to us the natural conclusion, thus, is to devolve these lands to its rightful owner, lest further injustice spread through the region."
col.1001.a: "A Natural Choice."
col.1001.b: "It is rightful, though."
