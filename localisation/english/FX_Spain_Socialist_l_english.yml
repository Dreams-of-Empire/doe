### Events ###

socspain.0.d: "Socialism established itself during the latter half of the 19th century, largely represented within the Spanish Socialist Worker's Party. Since then, there has always been a socialist presence in the country. Over time, more socialist movements were established on the edges of Spanish politics. \n\nAfter the dictatorship of Miguel Primo de Rivera, socialists experienced sufficient growth in popularity in the new Second Republic. This shows that the people do not want a kingdom or a liberal republic. What they want is socialism! When the monarchists attempted to coup the government - the coup that would lead to the start of the civil war - socialists rallied to their own flag. \n\nThe civil war will be the beginning of the revolution that will bring Spain into socialism. Long Live Socialism! Long Live the Revolution!"

socspain.8.t: "Conflict With the Republicans!"
socspain.8.d: "The non-aggression agreement between us and the Republicans has been broken. News of clashes at the border has started a conflict once again. It is time to see if Spain will be a republicn regime or a socialist paradise."

socspain.11.t: "Anti-Government Protests"
socspain.11.d: "Many people have started to blame the Socialist government for their misery in the aftermath of the London Crash. With war and unemployment, no one is happy that our government focusing too little on the civilians of Spain."

How are we going to act?"
socspain.13.a: "Side With the Communists Against the Anarchists!"

socspain.102.t: "A Congress of the Revolutionaries"
socspain.102.d: "With stability beginning to return, the governing PCE has been pressured by the other factions in this revolution, the moderate socialist PSOE and the radical anarcho-syndicalist CNT-FAI, to set up a congress where all of the factions can be represented. While this might improve relations between the factions, what we fear with this new congress is that other factions will try to take away our power."
socspain.102.a: "We Will See What Happens"

socspain.103.t: "Reports of More Conflict in the Streets"
socspain.103.d: "Recently, there have been more and more reports of clashes between anarchists and communists out on the streets of Madrid, Barcelona, and other cities in the country.

socspain.103.a: "Contact PSOE for Cooperation"
socspain.103.b: "Plan an Attack on the CNT-FAI"

socspain.104.t: "PSOE Agrees to Cooperate"
socspain.104.d: "After some hours in a secret meeting, the leaders of the moderate socialist PSOE have agreed to cooperate with the PCE government. While our cooperation can not be noticed by the anarcho-syndicalists, with time, we can secure a future and the revolution for Spain together."
socspain.104.a: "Happy to Come to an Agreement"

socspain.105.t: "The Anarcho-Syndicalist March"
socspain.105.d: "Today, many people, under the banner of the anarcho-syndicalist CNT-FAI, have started to march in the capital city of Madrid, protesting against the current system of governance and the ruling Communist Party.

socspain.106.t: "PSOE Changes Sides"

socspain.107.t: "The Army Storms the Government Buildings"
socspain.107.d: "The army has joined the side of the socialist PSOE and the anarcho-syndicalist CNT-FAI. Today, they entered the congress and arrested its PCE members.

socspain.107.a: "'José Díaz Ramos! You are under Arrest!'"

socspain.108.t: "The Aftermath"
socspain.108.d: "With the PCE government in captivity, and the PSOE and CNT-FAI victorious, the congress is holding a vote on what path the country shall follow. It is likely that the remaining members of congress will be rather split on what group to support to govern the country. The Spanish Socialist Worker's Party are more moderate than the CNT-FAI, but alib a little bit more authoritarian. On the other hand, the National Confederation of Labour and their allies in the Iberian Anarchist Federation are more radical than the PSOE, seeing both the authoritarian right and authoritarian left as enemies of the real revolution."

socspain.110.t: "The Head of the CNT-FAI Congress"
socspain.110.d: "With the CNT-FAI controlling the country, it is time to pick who is going to be the head of the new CNT-FAI Congress. It seems like the choice will be between an Anarchist and a Syndicalist."
socspain.110.a: "The Anarchist Oliver"
socspain.110.b: "The Syndicalist Pestaña"

socspain.111.t: "CNT-FAI Militias Seize the March"
socspain.111.d: "While our men stood in formation at the march, ready to arrest those causing problems, more and more armed men began to turn up, some even carrying extra weapons, with the intent of giving them to the other anarcho-syndicalists. The police have now been forced to react against this threat to prevent it from developing into a massacre. We must show them that they have gone too far."
socspain.111.a: "Now they have gone too far!"

socspain.112.t: "Stability Returns Following Purges"
socspain.112.d: "With purges against the anarcho-syndicalist CNT-FAI menance in the main cities of Spain, stability has begun to return. The police and many PCE loyal militia groups have reported that they have cracked open the hideouts of many anarcho-syndicalist militia groups, and given them the bullet. The revolution might be saved from those radicals in the CNT-FAI after all."
socspain.112.a: "This is a Good Development"

socspain.113.t: "PCE Strenghtens Control"
socspain.113.d: "With the anarcho-syndicalist CNT-FAI menance taken care of, and the moderate socialist PSOE remaining silent, it seems that the government's grip upon Spain is strong. There are even people in the PSOE that have become convinced to switch over to our movement instead. Finally can we secure the socialist revolution within Spain!"
socspain.113.a: "Long Live Socialism! Long Live the Revolution!"

socspain.114.t: "A Plot Against the Anarcho-Syndicalists"
socspain.114.d: "After many hours in meetings between the government and the army, a plan has been put together with the strong potential to work. It will help us root out and execute the leaders of the anarcho-syndicalists with a military operation into the houses and streets. While this might not sit as well with the moderate socialist PSOE, we can inform them about it in advance, if we so choose."
socspain.114.a: "Enact It!"

socspain.115.t: "Violence Grips the Streets"
socspain.115.d: "Violence has begun to break out as soldiers enter houses and streets in the cities of Spain. After an episode where an anarcho-syndicalist attacked a police squadron with a knife, the police have begun to use more violent meassures when raiding houses and taking prisoners. The anarcho-syndicalist members in congress have been placed under house arrest, with some being vocally opposed to our police and military's violent measures."
socspain.115.a: "We Will Crush the Anarchist Scum!"

socspain.116.t: "The PSOE Opposition"

socspain.118.d: "An agreement has been made between the PSOE and the PCE. Hopefully this will lead to the end of internal conflict."
socspain.118.a: "This Offer Will Lead to Victory"

socspain.119.t: "The Congress Moves to Elect a New Chairman"
socspain.119.d: "The Congress is now in the process of deciding who shall be the new Chairman of Spain, and the Successor to Spanish Socialism. This could take just days or a week, or it could last until the next year. \n\nThe current Chairman, José Díaz Ramos, has served more as an interim rather than a true Chairman. But he is one of those that has stepped forward to lead Spain into the future. Another candidate to become Chairman, or Chairwoman in this case, is Dolores Ibárruri, known as the Passionflower. She and Ramos hold many similar views, with both embracing Leninist Socialism. But there are those that would see a potential Chairwoman Ibárruri as a sign of gender equality in the country. \n\nThe young José Cazorla Maure is another who has stepped into the ring. He is one that was ruthless in weeding out sabotage or subversion, and he is generally disliked by Trotskyists and the Right-wingers. \n\nSpeaking of the right-wing of Socialism, there is a candidate from that wing in the form of Joaquín Maurín. It remains to be seen if he will be able to unite the party under his Right-wing agenda. \n\nThe last candidate is the Trotskyist Andrés Nin Pérez, who has even worked as secretary to Trotsky. He is looked down on by the Leninists and the National Collectivists, but perhaps he would be able to unite Spanish Socialism under his view."
socspain.119.a: "Let it Begin!"

socspain.120.t: "The Candidates Present Themselves"
socspain.120.d: "The candidates that have voiced their interest in trying to become the next Chairman came before the Congress today, expressing their views for the future. Ramos and Ibárruri focused on the dream of a Leninist Socialist nation. Maure advocated for a Socialist movement that is National and grants the country strength. Maurín expressed a vision for a Socialism with a new economic policy and marxist pluralism. Pérez spoke for a Permanent Revolution and supported proletarian Internationalism."
socspain.120.a: "Ramos' Ideas Found a Home in the Congress.."
socspain.120.b: "..But Ibárruri Expressed Them the Best"
socspain.120.c: "They Actually Liked Maure's Ruthlessness"
socspain.120.e: "Maurín's Approach to Marxist Pluralism Worked"
socspain.120.f: "Nin Pérez Reminded Them That the Revolution is International"

socspain.121.t: "Our International Focus"
socspain.121.d: "One way to find out who is going to become chairman is for the Congress to hear the candidates' proposed views for the future. The candidates are today presenting their views for international and foreign politics."
socspain.121.a: "Ramos and Ibárruri Teamed up For Soviet Cooperation"
socspain.121.b: "Maure Wanted a Strong Nation to Protect the Revolution"
socspain.121.c: "Maurín Rejected Soviet Cooperation"
socspain.121.e: "Nin Pérez Wanted to Spread the Revolution Internationally"

socspain.122.t: "Our Focus on Society"
socspain.122.d: "Spanish society is flawed, with many views on how to best fix it. The candidates are expected to have views on how they would make Spain better, through either more Progressive or more Conservative measures. Things like gender and race equality is an important topic as well for some in our party."
socspain.122.a: "Ramos Promises Some Progressive Reforms"
socspain.122.b: "Ibárruri Voices Interest in Gender Equality"
socspain.122.c: "Maure Reaffirms 'New' Traditional Values"
socspain.122.e: "Maurín Says Social Progress Comes With Pluralism"
socspain.122.f: "Nin Pérez Promises Social Revolution"

socspain.123.t: "Our Economic Focus"
socspain.123.d: "Socialism is as much a social movement as it is an economic system. While the candidates have similar views on economic issues, there are some things that set each of them apart."
socspain.123.a: "Ramos and Ibárruri Support New Land Reforms"
socspain.123.b: "Maure Voices Support for Collectivization and Central Planning"
socspain.123.c: "Maurín Wants a 'New Economic Policy'"
socspain.123.e: "Nin Pérez Favors an Economy That Will Advance the Revolution"

socspain.124.t: "The Ramos and Ibárruri Alliance"
socspain.124.d: "José Díaz Ramos and Dolores Ibárruri have agreed to work together, with both in the lead to become the next Chairman/Chairwoman of Spain. They see that their goals are not so different, and are willing to support each other. The question becomes; which of them will become the front-runner."
socspain.124.a: "José Díaz Ramos!"

socspain.125.t: "José Díaz Ramos is Declared Chairman!"

socspain.127.d: "José Díaz Ramos has gained more and more popularity in the Congress, and even on the streets of Spain. It is very likely that the Congress will elect him as Chairman."

socspain.128.t: "'La Pasionaria' Have a Good Chance"
socspain.128.d: "Dolores Ibárruri has gained more and more popularity, not only among the people, but alib among many in the Congress. It is likely that the Congress will elect her as Chairwoman."
socspain.128.a: "It is Looking Good for Her"

socspain.129.t: "José Cazorla Maure Seems to Become More Popular"
socspain.129.d: "It looks like José Cazorla Maure has a big chance to become the next Chairman, as his popularity has grown in the Congress and on the streets. But while he is no Trotskyist, his ideology has been seen as a dangerous one by many revolutionaries. The military has asked if they shall be needed to deal with this."
socspain.129.a: "No! If he wins, it is fair!"

socspain.137.t: "Trotskyist Popularity"
socspain.137.d: "Andrés Nin Pérez seems more and more likely to win. The popularity of the Trotskyist has risen, and many are afraid what might happen if he is let into power. We now have the option to take action and depose him, to avoid that possibility."

socspain.137.b: "Call Upon the Military!"

socspain.138.a: "Viva el Presidente!"

socspain.139.d: "With the military managing to save Spain from Nin Pérez and his supporters, it is time to give power back to José Díaz Ramos.

socspain.152.t: "The Soviets Reject Our Entry Into the International"
socspain.152.d: "The request we have sent to the Soviet Union has been answered. Unfortunately, they have rejected us. While we have tried to argue that this is a step back for the global Revolution, they have stood strong in their rejection. Our government does see it, however, as their loss."
socspain.152.a: "That Will be Their Loss"

socspain.153.t: "A Greeting to Moskva"
socspain.153.d: "The ties between the Spanish Socialists and the Soviet Union is clear for anyone to see. Both are countries where the exploited workers have risen up against the capitalists, and won. We stand with the same enemies before us; Capitalists, Valkists, Imperialists. This binds us together, both politically and as enemies of our enemies."

socspain.160.a: "Long Live Spain!"

socspain.161.d: "There is a growing recognition out in the world of our regime. With more and more people, countries and organization recognizing our legitimacy, this have made things slightly easier. Still, there are many not recognizing the true government of Spain."

socspain.162.d: "There is a growing recognition out in the world of our regime. While there is a majority of foreign countries that recognize us, there are still some that does not. At least we can say that most countries do see us as the true government of Spain."

socspain.163.d: "There is a growing recognition out in the world of our regime. Now, it is just those that strongly support the other factions, and strongly oppose us, that don't recognize us. We can truly proclaim with the worlds agreement, that we are the true government of Spain."

socspain.165.t: "International Trade Recognition"
socspain.165.d: "There is some countries that do not recognize us as the true and legitimate government of Spain. But with growing merchant trade and exports, we see countries previously staying away from us approaching us as a new trade partner. This, in effect, strengthen the international recognition of us."
socspain.165.a: "With Trade Comes Growth"
