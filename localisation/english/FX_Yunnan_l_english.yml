YUN_paternal_autocrat_party: "Long Yun's Clique"
YUN_paternal_autocrat_party_long: "Army of National Pacification (Jing Guo Dian Jun)\n§gLong Yun emerged as the only man capable of quelling the falling out between the various factions of the Army of National Pacification. Even if it meant having to turn on his own brother, he undertook the necessary measures to entrench his administration in Kunming and hold the city. Now that the dust has settled after this period of brief civil war, it remains to be seen if this young, ambitious Yi General has what it takes to rebuild Yunnan. Long Yun had often dreamed of one day surpassing Tang Jiyao, and now he finally has a chance to do just so.§!"

YUN_national_populist_party_long: "Minority Nationalists\n§gYunnan Province is home to dozens of ethnic groups and religious beliefs, its frontiers have long been an untamed, rebellious backwater that the Kunming administration has struggled to suppress. The various tribes, chieftains and religious sects have long felt that their ways of life were under attack from China's Han and Manchu elites. With the legacy of great wars like the Panthay Rebellion still looming over the province, it would not take much to provoke the tribes to take action, especially if they sense a moment of weakness from Kunming.§!"
