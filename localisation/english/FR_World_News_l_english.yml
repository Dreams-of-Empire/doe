worldnews.6.d: "[This.GetNewspaperHeader]In recent weeks, a string of poor decisions from Austria's newly elected Government led to an outburst of chaos within the nation. It seems that the German Fuhrer, Adam Dressler, was keen on taking advantage of the situation. Without any formal warning, German troops advanced into Austria, occupying several key locations, with the alleged goal of 'maintaining order within the region'. Austria was soon under the complete mercy of Germany, who unsurprisingly "insisted" that the Austrian Nationalrat held a vote concerning the unification of the two nations 'for the sake of mutual security'. The results were decisively Pro-Union, with 106 out of the 165 members of the Nationalrat ruling in favour of Union. However, the honesty of the vote is dubious, as the ruthless German Thuleschutztruppe was heavily present in the Nationalrat during the vote."

### Literature
worldnews.13.t: "Ernest Raymond - A Fourth Rome"
worldnews.13.d: "The rising British novelist, Ernest Raymond, has released his new book ‘A Fourth Rome’. It has become the latest major work of alternate history in the British Empire, and has had notable cultural impact on the peoples of various nations.\n\nThe novel’s plot revolves around continued hostilities between Britain and France following the 1890’s, with the general point of divergence being that German Emperor Friedrich III never picking up a habit of smoking in the 1880’s. Hostilities between Britain and France would cause Britain to seek allies to help establish influence on the continent to counter France, and the survival of the German Emperor Friedrich III had assisted in bettering relations between Britain and Germany, paving way for an alliance between the two parties. France, however, was able to coax Italy and Russia into their own Entente, nonetheless setting a stage for the Great War, which would break out initially between France and Britain over a colonial border dispute.\n\nThe war would end and result in the loss of the Entente and the victory of the Central Powers. France would soon become prey to nationalist sentiment following their loss in the Great War, resulting in the establishment of a ‘highly Militarized Republic in which service guarantees citizenship’, which arguably blurred the lines between a Republic and a Junta. France would then install a similarly styled Republican Regime in Italy following France’s intervention in the Italian Civil War, which was induced by their loss in the Great War. Marco Brescil would rise to power in this newly established Partner-State to France, and would proclaim himself as ‘Caesar’, and would announce his goal to recreate an Civilization similar to Rome in nature (rather than territorially speaking).\n\nThe novel ends with yet another war between the German-led Central Powers and French-led Entente d’Acier, as a newborn ‘Fourth Rome’ scrambles to utilize the situation to their advantage. The novel has had profound impact throughout Britain, France, and Germany, and has contributed to a mutual rise of Germanophilia and Anglophilia in Britain and Germany respectively. Despite this, it has received large amounts of flak from critics, as the notion of a prolonged survival of Friedrich III has been considered as ‘nothing more than childish’. Raymond nonetheless defends his tale, stating that ‘something like this could have happened in another Universe’."
worldnews.13.a: "What a childish fantasy."
worldnews.14.t: "Eric Blair - Tides of Revolution"
worldnews.14.d: "The British writer known as Eric Blair has released ‘The Tides of Revolution’ earlier today, the plot of which ended up being received as shocking and controversial by a strong majority of the Imperial populace. A gripping story about a British Sailor fighting on behalf of the Freipakt in a global-scale war, the book details a world in which the Entente won the Great War, but at a dire cost. \n\nA lack of American entry to the Great War culminated in a much more drawn out and bloodier Great War, which ruined many Western member-states of the Entente. With both the Entente and Central Powers on the brink of collapse and unable to sustain further conflict; a shaky peace arrangement was reached which resulted in surprisingly little territorial concessions by either side. As the Entente was desperate to see the Bolshevik threat put down, they intervened to ensure victory of the Whites in the Russian Civil War. \n\nWith the end of a bloody Great War without any newly acquired territories to gleam, France soon fell into a civil war between the Republicans and Socialists, with the latter being the victor. In the process, all of their colonial holdings were either seized or declared independence. On the other side of the Rhine, a strong Nationalist sentiment began to rapidly brew in Germany and Russia, both of which quickly fell to Nationalist rhetoric. The two nations reached a common ground and shortly formed an alliance with the goal of ensuring global domination by the two countries. Additionally, with the British Empire passing the Statute of Westminster and steadily decentralizing coupled with the Austro-Hungarian Empire reforming into a federation of equals; the two nations quickly found themselves as the only liberal democracies remaining in Europe. In the Americas, the United States is struggling with internal politics more than ever; recent revolutions in Europe led to a colossal rise of Nationalist and Socialist sentiments, with polarization on the rise; a Civil War broke out; damaging the United States beyond repair. \n\nThe novel ends off with a 6-year strong Second Great War between the the French ‘P.R.I’, the ‘Russo-German Axis’ and the ‘Freipakt’, leading to tragic loss of life across the world. Whilst often criticized for lack of historical foundation and extensive creative liberties, it has nonetheless become a bestseller amongst the British Empire."

worldnews.15.t: "André Malraux - The Knife in the Letter"
worldnews.15.d: "A controversial tale of by the French writer André Malraux set on a future timeline has recently reached the shelves of France, depicting a scenario of a new world order after a Second Great War.\n\nThe story is a dystopian tale set in 1962, featuring an American man surviving in the divided midwest in a world locked in a nuclear stalemate. In this timeline, the German Reich goes to war with and successfully defeats the Entente and takes control of western Europe. In the eastern front, as chaos divides the Russians, the Soviet Union too falls very quickly, causing the Stahlpakt to dominate all of the European continent. Meanwhile, in the New World, a disunited and ill United States falls to the revanchist Mexican State, the federal government collapses and splinter states rise in North America, then as the rising Mexico begins to establish its sphere of influence in the New World, it comes into conflict with the British Empire in the Caribbean, leading to a joint war with Germany against the British. The war slows down into a grinding naval stalemate, until Germany creates the ultimate weapon, powered by the atom itself. After the Mexican bomb Jamaica and Barbuda with this nuclear weapon, the British finally accept to negotiate a peace, granting Germany several of its colonial possessions overseas and giving Mexico control of the Caribbean.\n\nAs a new world order is established, German-Mexican relationships break, as well as the Stahlpakt collapses as Germany oversteps its boundaries, causing widespread resentment, up until economic crisis causes it to isolate itself. The British then begin ignoring the peace treaty terms and challenging the Reich’s influence in the world. Thus by 1962, the world is locked in a nuclear stalemate between the German Reich, the Greater Mexican State, and the British Empire, all looking to be the dominant world power.\n\nThe Novel ends with the beginning of a new nuclear crisis as the Mexican set up a missile base in their allied territory near the Great Lakes, threatening Canada, and causing the worldwide panic as the British prepare to deal with this aggression. While many criticize the book for its huge gaps in plausibility and exaggerated proposals of future technology, the gripping political tension that wraps every part of the story has lead it to great success amongst all of the Entente."

While the results are very controversial little eveidence of fraud can be found. The economic disaster of Black Wednesday pushed many Italian voters to the extreme ends of politics. This has not stopped many on the right from protesting against their victory though. The Communist have had a long history of causing social unrest in Italy with demands of sweeping social and legal changes. Many are worried that this may be the end of Italian democracy as we know it and some even claim that party leader Antonio Gramsci, who is rumored to have connections with the Soviet Union, may create a single party state.

In the wake of Black Wednesday public support for the party had shruken quite considerable but to the mainstream Italian voter the Liberals are seen as the most sensible and practical party in the the face of an ever changing world. It will be a rough few years ahead for Luigi Einaudi and his party. The Communists blame his Laissez-faire economic policies for the recent depression impacting Italy while The right wing criticize his government for being weak and ineffectual.

Black Wednesday had shown many Italians that Liberal economics would not be able to bring economic stability to the country. Many centrist voters who have become disilusioned with the Liberals see the Social Democrats as the only sensible reformist party in Italy. Even some of the more moderate Communists admit that thier victory may bring much needed reforms. Now in power the Progressives will hopefully fulfill their campaign promises and introduce a welfare system to Italy."

Luigi Sturzo does not seem to be worried by this though and promises to 'deal with' extremists who threaten the stability of Italy. Sturzo has a long history of threating violence against the Left and in an Italy that seems on brink of a Communist uprising many see him as the only person that can guarantee their safty. When it comes to foreign affairs the Conservatives promise to develop Italian colonial territories and stregnthen relations with Britain and her Empire and on the domestic side they pledge to protect traditional Italian culture and lead the nation towards economic recovery"

The majority of the deputies submitted to the coup while the few who tried to oppose, mostly Communist, were dragged outside and executed by firing squad. Both France and England have protested the coup and have yet to recognize the new government. Now that the Italian military has seized control some leaders like Luigi Capello, a hero of the Great War, suggest a quick restoration of a civillian government while Pietro Badoglio instead proposed to invite the third duke of Savoy-Aosta, Amedeo, to become head of state but rumors are rampant that Italo Balbo may use his new found influence to proclaim himself dictator or "Duce" of Italy."

worldnews.109.d: "[This.GetNewspaperHeader]While touring Beijing today, Zhang Zuolin, the erstwhile leader of the Fengtian Governancy, was shot dead by Japanese loyalists under the banner of the Concordia Association. Beijing, which came to be part of Fengtian only some short years ago, served as a shining example of China's commitment to both the past and future, as well as the de jure capital of the state itself. Most strangely, Zuolin was in the capital that day discussing the warming of relations between the Fengtian government and the Empire of Japan. The touring of speeches, which had marked one of Zuolin's most salient actions while in power, had been considered by many to be one of the most important political events in China in the past few years. Whatever it was that international spectators hoped to gain from these words has now been lost forever as China comes ever closer to all out war."
