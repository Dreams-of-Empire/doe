monspain.15.t: "King Alfonso's Legacy"
monspain.15.d: "While we trust in our monarch, King Alfonso XIII, we should still be critical on what Spain has experienced under his reign as king of Spain. His reign has been, for some, seen as a bad time for the monarchist cause. Maybe he should abdicate, and let his heir become king?!"

monspain.100.t: "Recruitment Campaign in Monarchist Spain"

monspain.102.t: "The First Post-Civil War Government"
monspain.102.d: "With the civil war over, and recovery near to completion, the time has arrived for the king to pick his first post-civil war government. At the king's table, there are three possible choices. \n\nThere is the Catalan League, an unlikely choice since they are Catalan nationalists and pro-democratic. The king fears that they might give rise to a new republic. But they are also loyal to the king, and can help absolve the royal family of its authoritarian legacy. \n\nThere is also the Spanish Confederation of Autonomous Rights, or CEDA. They are the group with the strongest influence in the current government. They are conservative and catholic, and they hold marches similar to the valkists in Germany. While they are authoritarian, there are those among them who want to retain some form of democracy. These are the most likely to be chosen. \n\nThe last option is the Renovación Española. The RE is conservative, monarchist and authoritarian. They seek a new age of authoritarian monarchism in the country. With their close links to the conservative and authoritarian parts of our military, they might be a good first or second choice."
monspain.102.a: "Might be Close to Suicide, but the Catalans Will Have Their Chance"

monspain.105.t: "The King Distances Himself from Authoritarianism"
monspain.105.d: "The king has now officially distanced himself from authoritarianism. In a speech, he said that the future of Spain will be that of a democratic kingdom."
monspain.105.a: "This Will Work!"

monspain.106.t: "The Democratic Kingdom!"
monspain.106.d: "Democracy has returned to the Kingdom of Spain. From now on, Spain will be a constitutional monarchy, in the style of the British Empire, Beligium, or Sweden."
monspain.106.a: "Long Live the King! Long Live Democracy!"

monspain.107.t: "The [GetYear] Spanish General Election"
monspain.107.d: "With the parliamentarian monarchy having been restored in Spain, it is time for the first true and democratic election since Primo de Rivera took power in the 1920s. With the decrease of authoritarian parties, and the rise of liberal parties, Renovación Española have no chance in gaining enough seats to form a government.

monspain.150.d: "Our monarchist friends in the Kingdom of Spain appraoched us today in order to request entry into the Imperial Protection Alliance. With them on our side, our alliance would secure an extra ally against Germany, the Soviet Union, and even France. The downside would be that we might need to provide for Spain's own defence if war should come."
monspain.150.a: "They Are Welcomed!"
monspain.150.b: "Sorry, but no"

monspain.151.t: "The British Accept us Into the IPA"
monspain.151.d: "The British Empire has answered our request to join the Imperial Protection Alliance. Fortunately, they have accepted our peitition to join their alliance!

monspain.151.a: "Spain and Britain Will Fight Together!"

monspain.152.t: "The British Reject Our Entry Into the IPA"
monspain.152.d: "The British Empire has answered our request to join the Imperial Protection Allaince. Unfortunately, they have rejected our petition to enter their alliance.

monspain.153.t: "The Kingdom of Spain Sends Support"
monspain.153.d: "The Kingdom of Spain has acknowledged our fight for tradition and monarchy, and has sent their support to us. We will of course reply with our thanks. With our eventual victory over the traitors, we will see an era of friendship and brotherhood between Spain and Portugal."
monspain.153.a: "Thanks to our Spanish Friends!"

monspain.154.t: "A Visit to London"
monspain.154.d: "The ties between the two Kingdoms, Spain and Great Britain, are growing ever stronger. With both countries having a tradition of monarchy and seafaring Empires, we have found much in common with each other. While we might have had our fights over the last 500 years, we are only bound closer together today."
monspain.154.a: "A Cheer to our British Friends"

monspain.155.t: "Spanish Agents and Diplomats"
monspain.155.d: "With the Spanish monarchy establishing itself as the legitimate government of Spain, Spain seeks to expand its sphere of influence here on the island of Cuba, coming back after the Americans kicked them out nearly half a century ago. While our leadership includes many that are skeptical of these Spanish agents and diplomats, some in our government recognize them as a friendlier, and perhaps more helpful, face than those in Washington."
monspain.155.a: "Better Them Than Washington"
monspain.155.b: "Cuba Will Not Bow to Their Influence"

monspain.156.t: "Our Influence is Accepted in Cuba"
monspain.156.d: "It was not assured that we would gain influence in Cuba when we sent our agents there. But now, the Cubans have apparently accepted our activities on the island.

Cuba will be the start of something new."
monspain.156.a: "In Time, We Will Have Cuba Back"

monspain.157.t: "The Cubans Reject Spanish Influence"
monspain.157.d: "It was not assured that we would gain influence in Cuba when we sent our agents there. Today, this was confirmed with the Cuban rejection of our agents' activites, alongside a rather cold welcome to our new Ambassador. It looks like the leaders of this island would much rather see their country remain under Anglo-American influence instead of allowing a Hispanic friendship to be formed."
monspain.157.a: "What a Shame.."

monspain.158.t: "Spaniards Back in Caracas?"
monspain.158.d: "With the Spanish monarchy establishing itself as the legitimate government of Spain, agents of the king have appeared in Caracas. This time, they are clearly trying to spread Spanish influence in Venezuela. Some in our government have argued that this could mean assuring Spain as a potential ally against aggression from Brazil, Colombia, or the United States. Others sees it as a betrayal against El Liberatador and a free Venezuela."
monspain.158.a: "So Long As We Keep Our Independence"
monspain.158.b: "No! Bolivar Would Turn in His Grave"

monspain.159.t: "Our Influence is Accepted in Caracas"
monspain.159.d: "It was not assured that we would gain influence in Venezuela when we sent our agents there. Fortunately for us, they have allowed our influence in Caracas. While our Ambassador has been well-welcomed there, the Venezuelans have also been clear that they are not interested in becoming a Spanish colony again. We have assured them that we are together only in Hispanic friendship."
monspain.159.a: "Together, We Are Strong!"

monspain.160.t: "The Venezuelans Reject Spanish Influence"
monspain.160.d: "It was not assured that we would gain influence in Venezuela when we sent our agents there. Unfortunately, they have rejected our attempts to grow our influence there. Our Ambassador has received a clear message that the Venezuelean government is not interested in drawing closer with us. Clearly, they are more interested in falling under Anglo-American influence."
monspain.160.a: "What a Shame..."

monspain.161.t: "International Recognition is Growing"
monspain.161.d: "There is a growing recognition out in the world of our regime. While it is still quite low, it is good to know that there are those that know that we are the true government of Spain."
monspain.161.a: "Long Live Spain!"

monspain.162.d: "There is a growing recognition out in the world of our regime. With more and more people, countries and organization recognizing our legitimacy, this have made things slightly easier. Still, there are many not recognizing the true government of Spain."

monspain.163.d: "There is a growing recognition out in the world of our regime. While there is a majority of foreign countries that recognize us, there are still some that does not. At least we can say that most countries do see us as the true government of Spain."

monspain.164.d: "There is a growing recognition out in the world of our regime. Now, it is just those that strongly support the other factions, and strongly oppose us, that don't recognize us. We can truly proclaim with the worlds agreement, that we are the true government of Spain."

monspain.165.t: "International Trade Recognition"
monspain.165.d: "There is some countries that do not recognize us as the true and legitimate government of Spain. But with growing merchant trade and exports, we see countries previously staying away from us approaching us as a new trade partner. This, in effect, strengthen the international recognition of us."
monspain.165.a: "With Trade Comes Growth"
