### Description
USA_FUHRERREDUX_DESC: "Participating in the Great War on both the Mexican and European fronts, Theodore Roosevelt left the tables at Versailles angered at the stringent and demanding treaty. A nation now in political isolation, the country has descended into deep economic troubles. In the midst, several of the nation's holdings declared their own independence, including their Mexican client state. Now, with few friends and a couple powerful enemies, America stands divided as another great conflict looms on the horizon."

usa.0.t: "The State of Old Glory"
usa.0.d: "America's troubled history of foreign intervention has strained its relations with major world powers. The recent merger of the Bull Moose Party into the Republican Party has raised questions about Theodore Roosevelt's legacy. Roosevelt aimed to keep the US out of the brewing European war but faced challenges, including Mexican nationalist Victor Carranza's mobilization in response to American actions. The Zimmerman Declaration further escalated tensions, leading to a war that lasted from 1917 to 1919 and resulted in significant American casualties. Roosevelt's attempts at a moderate peace were unsuccessful, causing a rift in US-European diplomacy.\n\nThe focus shifted to the conquered neighbor, Mexico, and exploiting its resources. After Roosevelt's death, subsequent presidents faced challenges, including the economic downturn of 1929. The upcoming 1936 election, marked by the Great Depression, presents choices for a new direction in domestic and foreign policy, amid the rise of far-right and far-left movements. The United States finds itself in a precarious position as it navigates these complex dynamics and seeks to redefine its role in the world."

None of the four major parties have secured enough votes in the Electoral College to outright win the presidency, and as a result, the House of Representatives has to vote on the winner of the election for the second time this decade. This is probably not the end of our problems, but for the time being, victory goes to..."

Included at the scene is what officers have been identifying as the flag of the Mexican State, though additional forensics research will have to be conducted. The target of the attack is believed to be a rail and trasportation hub in the city, but exactly which is not yet known, either. What is known, however, is that the political climate in the country has taken a drastic turn for the worse, and it will certianly only go downhill from here."

Debs had an extensive history in American politics, having been a union leader who contested Theodore Roosevelt's election campaigns in 1912 and 1916 to less than stellar results. After having narrowly been found innocent of sedition in his condemnation of American actions against Mexico, and by extension to Central Powers, by the Supreme Court, he continued to be a controverial figure. Debs also contested the 1920 Presidential election on the Socialist Party ticket but was again very unsuccessful. While he remained de facto leader of the Socialist Party, he discontinued his runs for President from then on, and the Socialist Party has stagnated ever since, in the major margin of American politics. He appointed some weeks ago journalist and unioneer Jack Reed as his successor, though with Debs's death the transition has become official. Many spectators cannot say exactly what the fate of the party will be now, but it will probably suffer divisions in power following its suzerain leader's death."
