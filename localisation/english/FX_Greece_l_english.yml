#### History ####
GRE_FUHRERREDUX_DESC: "With our successful campaign against the Turks, the dream of Megáli Idéa has been realized and our status has been secured. Our Ethnarch and incumbent leader Elefthérios Venizélos, having sidelined the opposition with his popular reforms rules with a velvet glove.\n\nHowever the abysmal economic situation, the slow economic withering of Smyrna and Hellenization policies have caused wide unrest within our country. Elections are coming, and only time will tell what will happen to the Nation of the Hellenes."

#### Political Parties ####
GRE_valkist_party: "ESKE"
GRE_valkist_party_long: "Ethnikón Sosialistikón Kómma Elládos \n§gEstablished in Athens in December 1932, the party emerged after Merkouris who had previously shown sympathy to German Volkish trade unions, split from Dimitrios Gounaris and the Populist Party over the need to lean towards reforism. Fiercely supportive of Valkism, the Hellenic National Socialist Party seeks to copy its German counterpart in organizational and policy terms, but offer an unique version of Valkism in which it would seek to “restore National Unity, Social Solidarity and Discipline as a means of achieving the fuller moral and material well-being of the people”.§!"
GRE_vanguardist_party: "KAKE"
GRE_vanguardist_party_long: "Kommounistikó Archeiomarxistikó Kómma Elládas \n§gThe Communist Archio-Marxist Party of Greece is a communist political party in Greece, active from 1934. It belongs to a subgenre of Marxism–Leninism and Trotskyism known as Archeio-Marxism (Archive-Marxism) and appears to have been the last scion of that ideology. Its leader, Dimitrios Giotopoulos, also known by his primary alias "Witte", is the leader of the KAKE. Before its formation, he had been a leader of the Greek Archio-Marxists, which had been one of the by far largest dissident communist movements in Greece during the early-to-mid-1930s, as members of Leon Trotsky's "Left Opposition". KAKE split from Trotsky's movement in 1934 after significant ideological fallout. While overshadowed by the major Communist Party, KAKE continues its activites as it waits for the proper moment to assert itself as the true successor of socialism, even though rumors claim that Giotopoulos is collaborating with the right.§!"

Adopting the principles of Marxism-Leninism, the Communist Party of Greece is the main vanguard of the revolution within the political scene.

GRE_social_democrat_party_long: "Dimokratikós Synaspismós \n§gOriginating from members of the "Society of Sociologists" including staunch republican leader Alexandros Papanastasiou, socialist elements of the Liberal Party under George Papandreou and progressives from George Kafantaris' Progressive Party, the Democratic Allignment is an alliance of likewise individuals seeking radical solutions for the ever increasing problems of the new century, against both to communists and capitalists.§!"

It was founded in August 1910 by Eleftherios Venizelos and has went to dominate politics for 26 years. It represents the centrist elements of Greek society, and supported by the middle class and the populations of the New Lands and Anatolia.

The Union mainly follows behind its leader, Georgios Kondylis, a dissafected venizelist general with increasingly authoritarian tendecies and mistrust for the Liberals.

GRE_social_conservative_party_long: "Laïkón Kómma \n§gThe People's Party is considered the main force of Conservatism in Hellas. It attracts the Elite, the Magnates, Moderate Monarchists and the Clergy. Founded in 1920, Gounaris and his parliamentary candidates campaigned for the withdrawal of the Hellenic Army from Asia Minor, which it occupied under the terms of the Treaty of Sèvres in the aftermath of World War I. Failing to win the 1920 election against the Venizelists and the subsequent victory in the Greco-Turkish war, the party suffered great losses and was in the brink of dissolution, only saved through Gounaris' political maneuvering.

Created in the city of Thessaloniki, initally under the name of "Macedonian Union", its original aim was for the decentralization of the Macedonian Region from the rule of the "Athens Regime" and the regional interests of the slavic population, with supporters of slavic origin even calling for secession.

gre.0.t: "The Second Hellenic Republic"
gre.0.d: "Greece emerged victorious from the 1912-1913 Balkan Wars with her territory almost doubled, but found iteself in a difficult international situation. In 1914 another danger would emerge from the Assasination of Franz Ferdinand, which Greece was allied with Serbia. Initially neutral, Venizelos supported participation with the Entente while the King anticipated a German victory. This led to a power struggle between Liberals and Royalists, where the King dismissed Venizelos unconstitutionally. Following other incidents and humiliations from the royalist Athens government, the State of National Defence was established in Thessaloniki to fight alongside the Allies. Venizelos instead of pursuing a more moderate path, decided that the monarchy had outlast its usefulness and set out to declare the Second Hellenic Republic. The division of the country lasted 9 months, as an Allied ultimatum forced the King and the Royal Family to flee in Switzerland.\nVenizelos returned to Athens, as head of a superficially reunified Greece, and led it to victory alongside the Allies in World War I, but also in its entanglement in the subsequent Asia Minor Campaign which led to the Partition of the Ottoman Empire and the ratification of the Treaty of Sèvres. The following years saw success for Venizelos' Liberal Party, securing the majority in every election, reforms were pushed and the remaining royalist sentiments were purged from the Republic.\nHowever the economic situation couldn't be worse, as Smyrna doesn't have access to the raw materials of deep Anatolia and needs to rely on the other side for economic support, debts are skyrocketing and unrest starts to grow within the population. It's 1936 and with the rise of Valkism the Hellenic Republic is in a weak position. Will the nation of the Hellenes withstand against all odds?"
gre.0.a: "As Elpísoume... (Let's hope...)"
gre.1.t: "The Challenges Ahead"
gre.1.d: "The Second Hellenic Republic, which faces its next election in 1936, faces several challenges before then, most prominent is the simmering resentment towards the policies of the Liberals and Venizelos. Most are certain that war is coming again soon, with many groups such as the communist and the looming figures of the far-right waiting for the first moment the government makes the slightest misstep. Extremist sentiment is also on the rise, with many flocking to either side hoping to see radical changes... with the establishment fearing that doing so would only plunge the nation into anarchy yet again."
gre.1.a: "We shall not repeat past mistakes."
gre.2.t: "Independence Day"
gre.2.d: "In 1821, Greeks rose up against the oppressive Ottoman Empire, which had occupied Greece for nearly four hundred years. Bishop Germanos of Patras boldly raised the Greek flag at the monastery of Agia Lavras, inciting the Greek revolution. While the exact date probably was not March 25th, it did occur in late March and it was gradually associated with the religious feast of the Annunciation which occurs on the same date. On the day of the Feast of the Annunciation the archangel Gabriel appeared to the maiden Mary and announced the news, she was pregnant with the divine child. Bishop Germanos chose this day to deliver a different but not unrelated message, a new spirit was about to be born in Greece."
gre.2.a: "A new spirit shall be born again!"
gre.3.d: "Independence Day is celebrated once again in [Root.GetNameDef], with crowds lining the streets in Athens and other cities, all waving the Greek flag and singing 'Ýmnos is tin Eleftherían' - the Hymn to Freedom, and the country's national anthem. Despite all the hardship the country has faced, its people are still eager to celebrate their sense of independence from those who would oppress them."
gre.3.a: "Hail, o hail, Liberty!"

Deficit is growing, debts still remain unpaid and our workers slowly starting to grow inpatient. Years of expenditure for the army has caused our industries to crumble, our shops closing with a feeling of uncertainty looming over the horizon. Truly and regretfully, we are bankrupt, again...."
GRE_economic_withering_of_smyrna: "Economic Withering of Smyrna"
GRE_economic_withering_of_smyrna_desc: "Smyrna, the jewel of the Near East, is our most precious possesion since our victory in the Greco-Turkish war. Of course, with any victory comes the price. Since the Turks refuse to export their resources to the ports of Anatolia, the city as well as the whole region have begun to see a period of economic withering and in constant need of economic support, coming straight out of our pockets."
GRE_minority_unrests: "Minority Unrests"
GRE_minority_unrests_desc: "Our country as a whole consists of many ethnicities, such as the Slavic speakers in Macedonia, the Albanians in Epirus and the Muslims in Anatola and Eastern Thrace. Although cooperative, our recent attempts to Hellenize the populace has been seen with hostile reaction, with many openly rebelling. Solutions must be found if we ever wish to truly integrate them into our society."

As long as the Republic stands, the officer corps stand ready to assist the goverment in all manners concerning the protection and the expansion of the state."
GRE_anathema: "Anáthema"
GRE_anathema_desc: "Even though the Liberals enjoy wide support, there are also many who wish to see its downfall. From Conservatives to Valkists, to Socialists and Communists, Venizelos and his allies are seen as a huge obstacle to their schemes of gaining power. Only through proper maneuvering and proper measures will we ever put an end to this political bickering."
