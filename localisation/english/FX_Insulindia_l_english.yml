POLTICS_SUKARNO_DESC: "The son of Javanese aristocrats, the young Sukarno came into the world in 1901. Sukarno first became interested in politics when he was introduced to the unique philosophy of a farmer named Marhaen, whose personal political philosophy inspired Sukarno to found the PNI in 1926. The other great influence for Sukarno's basis of elected rule was the Algemeene Studieclub, which studied Dutch translations of the German constitution. Now that independence is here, Sukarno is beholden to the many faiths and desperate ideologies of Insulindia to unify all people in the archipelago."
