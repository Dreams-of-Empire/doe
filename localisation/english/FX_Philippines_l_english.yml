### History
PHI_FUHRERREDUX_DESC: "For hundreds of years, the Filipino people have been subjugated to oppressive colonial and imperialistic rule; first the Spanish, and now the Americans. The people is thirsty for liberty and freedom their new overlords have paraded itself upon. Now it may finally within their grasp, as the Great Depression weakens the United States; and talks of immediate independence in on the horizon.\nBut what would newly found independence bring; prosperity? or an opportunity to another imperialist power to assert control? One way is certain, the Filipinos needs to viciously defend their freedoms and liberteries, or they will be back to where they came."

### Events
philippines.0.t: "The Pearl of the Orient, 1936"
philippines.0.d: "In 1898, after 333 years of colonization from the Spanish, liberty and independence was finally in the grasp of the Filipinos fighting against oppression; much to their disappointment however, the Americans whom they see as their allies in kicking the Spanish in the archipelago, have opted to annex the Philippines after they bought it from Spain. This resulted in a bloody war between the Americans and Filipino revolutionaries, replacing an oppressor with another.\n\nThe Americans ultimately won, abolishing the first Republic of Emilio Aguinaldo. However, this does not destroy the dreams of the Filipinos of an independent nation, where they are free and with liberty. In 1912, the Jones Act, or the Philippine Autonomy Act was signed by President Theodore Roosevelt replacing the Philippine Organic Act of 1902. This allowed election of members of both the lower and upper houses of the legislature to be elected.\n\nAs the Great Depression weakened the United States, President Herbert Hoover signed the Hare-Hawes-Cutting Act of 1933, granting the Philippines independence after a 10-year transition period. This act also allowed the election of a Filipino President and Vice-President, abolishing the position of the American Governor-General but establishing the position of the American High Commissioner. Governor-General Frank Murphy designated July 10, as the election date, with Manuel Luis Quezon of the Nacionalista Party winning.\n\nIn 1936, as the Great Depression continued to plague the American economy, one of the last minute reforms by the Curtis Administration was to grant independence to the Philippines immediately, to ease of expenditure and to lower the effects of the depression; and once again, the dreams of liberty and freedom is in the grasp of the Filipinos."

It has been found that a radical faction within the Catholic Church, together with their supporters in the government and military are planning to overthrow the democratically elected government of [Root.GetLeader] and replace it with the government appointed by the Pope himself. The Catholic Church and the Malacanan Palace has not released a comment regarding this relevation but one thing is for sure, this truly shocked the nation and divided it even more..."

philippines.108.t: "Felix Manalo Arrested for Blasphemy"
philippines.108.d: "The ironically named Church of Christ currently headed by Felix Manalo, who claims himself as the last messenger of God, that is sent to reestablish the first church founded by Jesus Christ which he claims to have fallen into apostasy following the death of the Apostles. His teachings rejects the idea of Trinity, which ultimately rejects the idea of Jesus Christ as Lord and Savior, which is a total blasphemy according to the teachings of the church.\n\nManalo is currently imprisoned in the Manila City Jail, guarded by a couple of Palatine Guards and regular jail guards. Many of his supporters took the streets and protest, but ultimately dispersed by the soldiers of the Filipino Papal Armed Forces."

philippines.109.t: "The Crown's Representative in Manila"
philippines.109.d: "As we have pacified the radical Filipino Government and have established a collaborative government loyal to us and the Crown. There are countless of suggestions and oppositions in the current setup of the collaborative government in Manila. The current setup is currently like the old Filipino Government, which they inherited from the Americans, a presidential republic. Some within the government suggest that we reorganize the government in Manila like here at home and our dominions, a parliamentary republic. However, switching the Philippines into a parliamentary republic can cause some issues initially but can be better in the long run, and if we install a Governor-General at the helm, we can keep an eye onto the Government."
philippines.109.a: "Install a member of the Royal Family as the Governor-General"
philippines.109.b: "Remain it as it is"
philippines.110.t: "Rumours of Aswang in Capiz"
philippines.110.d: "On that ominous night in the remote barrio of Capiz province, the air was heavy with a foreboding silence. Nestled near the base of the mountain, the farmland had always been a sanctuary, but now it was marred by a chilling incident. Responding to the distress call from the terrified residents, a group of barrio's watchmen and Philippine Constabulary units arrived, their senses heightened by the urgency of the situation. The lifeless body of Antonio Dimalanta's pregnant wife, her womb emptied of its precious contents, hinted at the gruesome presence of an Aswang. Suspicion fell upon an elderly woman living alone, but no concrete evidence could confirm her guilt.\n\nThe fear that gripped the barrio was palpable, prompting the municipal mayor and local police to take swift action. Armed with guns, salt, bottles of holy water from the cathedral, and an abundance of garlic, they orchestrated a comprehensive patrol strategy to safeguard the entire remote town. Their footsteps resonated through the night, blending with the collective heartbeat of a community united in their quest to unravel the sinister truth. Amidst the darkness, they stood prepared, the flickering flames of determination illuminating their path as they confronted the menacing forces lurking in the shadows."
philippines.110.a: "Does an aswang really exist though?"

### Character Descriptions
POLITICS_MANUEL_LUIS_QUEZON_DESC: "Manuel Luis Quezon was a son of a schoolteacher and small landholder. In 1899, he left his law studies at the University of Santo Tomás in Manila, to join the struggle for independence against Spain. Although considered \"bright but lazy\", he displayed his fearless, bold and quick-tempered style of fighting and ultimately rose to the ranks from private to major.\n\nAfter the defeat of the revolutionaries against the Americans however, Quezon returned to the university, and obtained his degree. He was convinced that the only way to independence was through cooperation with the Americans, and little by little, he made his way up the political ladder, from Governor to a Resident Commissioner of the Philippines. He played a major role in the Congress' approval of the Jones Act and Hare-Hawes-Cutting Act; which allowed him to be popular enough to be able to win the Presidency in 1933."
