### Events ###

estonia.1.t: "The Status of Estonia"
estonia.1.d: "Estonia first saw independence in the closing days of the Great War, in 1918, after having been ruled over by Livonians, Swedes and Russians through it's history. But independence would not be free, with both the German Empire and the newly formed Soviet Union trying to lay Estonia under their control. In early 1920, Estonia would, however, manage to hold on to their independence and their land.\n\nThe two decades following the independence of Estonia would be filled by political instability, with many weak and short lived coalition governments following over the years. The political instability gave room for a Soviet-supported uprising in 1924, that would, however, collapse as quickly as it rose up. It was clear that Estonia could not continue like this for much longer.\n\nIn the early 1930s, the instability and the growth of the right-wing Vaps Movement would lead to the government, led by Konstantin Päts, to initiate Martial Law. This would lead to the establishment of the Patriotic League by Päts and his supporters, increased censorship and the banning of all other political parties. Even with these measures, the Vaps Movement has continued to grow in popularity in Estonia, threatening the power of the President and the Patriotic League."
estonia.1.a: "Let Us See Where The Wind Blows"

estonia.2.t: "Rumors of a Coup"
estonia.2.d: "Since the start of the Martial Law back in 1934, there have always been some scares that opposition figures would initiate a coup against our government. Now, it seems like these scares might be well founded, as rumors of a plot to overthrow the Estonian government surfaces.\n\nWhile Estonia has managed to disband most political parties, there are no certainty that these former parties are not operating as if they were still in operation. Ecpesially the Vaps Movement is still around, even if they officially are disbanded and their leader, Andres Larka, is imprisoned. The Vaps might even be those behind this plot, if it is found out to be true."
estonia.2.a: "Look Further Into It.."

estonia.3.t: "A Plot to Overthrow the Government"
estonia.3.d: "Our investigation have lead to damning evidence that a plot to overthrow the Estonian government are out there. While our sources points to members of the Vaps Movement being behind this plot, there are no certainty that their leaders have anything with it. It is even as likely that it is another communist plot. Even then, it seems to only be the Vaps who has the popularity and influence in Estonia available to challenge us. While we have arrested Andres Larka, leader of the group, Artur Sirk, another leading figure in the movement, are still at large, currently in exile in Finland. He is still able, however, to pose a threat to our government."
estonia.3.a: "It Must Be Sirk!"
estonia.3.b: "Let's Refrain From Baseless Accusations"

estonia.4.t: "What to do With Sirk?"
estonia.4.d: "With Artur Sirk, the deputy leader of the Vaps Movement still in exile in Finland, it is difficult for us to try to arrest him without consulting the Finnish government. However, it is likely that the Finns will take our accusation of his involvement in the plot as fact, leading to a potential extradition.\n\nThere are also those that argues we should instead hire an assassin to kill Sirk, eliminating him once and for all. This would be a controversial option, and would make people see us as rather barbaric and tyrannical."
estonia.4.a: "Let Us Try to Arrest Him"
estonia.4.b: "Put Something in His Drink"

estonia.5.t: "Estonia Ask For the Extradition of Artur Sirk"
estonia.5.d: "Our brotherly neighbor in the south, Estonia, has requested us to extradite Artur Sirk, a leading figure in the Estonian Vaps Movement, to them. They have given us good evidence to extradite Mr. Sirk, with him being responsible for a plot to overthrow the Estonian government. While there are a small chance these crimes can be made up to make us extradite him, they would be too damning not to believe in. Even then, Estonia has not broken our trust before, so it seems like a safe choice."
estonia.5.a: "Here is Your Criminal"

estonia.6.t: "Artur Sirk Under Arrest"
estonia.6.d: "Today, a Finnish military plane landed on the air port in Talinn, bringing with them Artur Sirk. With the extradition playing out without any problems, we can finally put him, along with many other Vaps members under bars. No more will this spectre haunt the Estonian nation any longer."
estonia.6.a: "Larka, You Got Company!"

estonia.7.t: "The Death of Sirk"
estonia.7.d: "Our assassin have relieved news to us that the plot to assassinate Artur Sirk has been succsessful. On an late evening, while out drinking, our assassin managed to slip something into his drink while nobody saw it. But with his death, many now know that his death was more than just accidental food poisioning. The backlash from this could hurt our reputation and popularity, but the action taken might be necessary."
estonia.7.a: "Our Rule is Surely Secured"

estonia.8.t: "Riots Strikes the Nation"
estonia.8.d: "The news about the assassination of Artur Sirk has not been well received among his supporters in Estonia. Beginning as demonstrations of showing condolences to Sirk's friends and family, it quickly developed into several riots across the nation. These have also been fueled by the Finnish government, who is pissed at us for assassinating someone residing in their country."
estonia.8.a: "It Will Burn Out.."

estonia.9.t: "The [GetYear] Uprising"
estonia.9.d: "The riots and protests have devolved into an uprising against the Estonian government. While it is an uprising made up of many Vaps members and other anti-governmental groups, there seems to be little organization among these protesters. We are lucky to have the power of the Estonian army, headed by Johan Laidoner, on our side. It may be their time to show, yet again, that they are the protectors of Estonia."
estonia.9.a: "Call Upon Laidoner and the Army"

estonia.10.t: "The Uprising Crushed"
estonia.10.d: "Good news! The army has now recently managed to crush this uprising, securing the government's and army's control in Estonia. While the uprising and its end has led to many dead or injured, it is an acceptable sacrifice to the freedom and sovereignty of Estonia. Even then, it is commander in chief Johan Laidoner, not Konstantin Päts that is celebrated as the savior of the nation. Even then, it would be ludicrous to think he would use his power against us."
estonia.10.a: "Maybe He Deserves a Medal.. Just Maybe!"

estonia.11.t: "The Army Coups Declares Martial Law"
estonia.11.d: "With the uprising now dealt with, Johan Laidoner has now set his sight at the halls of government. Using the unrest and the uprising to his advantage, Laidoner have now used the army to coup Konstantin Päts and his government under the disguise of Martial Law. With this, the era of the Patriotic League's rule over Estonia has come to an end. Today, the era of military rule begins in Estonia."
estonia.11.a: "For A Strong and Self-Dependent Estonia"

estonia.12.t: "The Dissolution of the Patriotic League"
estonia.12.d: "With the government of Konstantin Päts overthrown, it is also time to end his Patriotic League. While it did some good for the nation, it was surely not enought to secure stability and peace in Estonia. Finally, Estonia can see an era of stability, not under any politician, but under the rule of the Commander-in-Chief!"
estonia.12.a: "An End of an Era.."

estonia.13.t: "Artur Sirk Reported Back in Estonia"
estonia.13.d: "It looks like our reports tells us that Artur Sirk, a leading figure in the Vaps Movement, have arrived this morning in Estonia, traveling by a fishing vessel over the Bay of Finland. His attempts to hide his identity have proved unsuccessful, as we quickly fouled his disguises. Now, the question is, shall we attempt to arrest him for his previous crimes, or let him go free."
estonia.13.a: "Go! Arrest Him"
estonia.13.b: "Let Us Wait.."

estonia.14.t: "The Arrestation of Artur Sirk"
estonia.14.d: "Today, police forces arrived at the residence of Artur Sirk, tasked with arresting him. While we believed this would go without problems, it is apparent that Mr. Sirk is not willing to go without a fight. By barring the door and refusing to comply with orders, his resistance to arrest is a little problem. Hopefully, we can attain him at the end of the day."
estonia.14.a: "Stop Fooling Around!"

estonia.15.t: "Artur Sirk Disappears"
estonia.15.d: "Mysteriously, Artur Sirk has disappeared. By one way or another, he managed to slip through our police forces. That is, at least, what we are told. There are some rumors that the police officers killed him and are trying to hide away the evidence. That is, at least, a theory gaining steam among his followers, proving that he has not regrouped with them. Regardless where he is, we hope he don't cause more damage in Estonia."
estonia.15.a: "Mysterious Indeed.."

estonia.16.t: "Reports of Desertions"
estonia.16.d: "Mysteriously, there have come in reports of soldiers and police officers deserting from their duties. This news sounds worrying, especially since we know that members of the Vaps Movement are still at large. Our investigations have not gathered any useful information yet."
estonia.16.a: "Strange"

estonia.17.t: "Sirk Escapes Arrest"
estonia.17.d: "Artur Sirk, the leading member of the Vaps Movement, have managed to escape our police forces. With he knowing that we are after him, he has begun to rally support from his supporters. Already, news of deserters have begun to arrive, among with a start of what looks like an uprising. We need to be prepared for the worst."
estonia.17.a: "Rally the Troops!"

estonia.18.t: "The Vaps Movement Uprising"
estonia.18.d: "This very morning, units loyal to the Vaps Movement stormed the capital of Talinn. Armed with military-grade weapons, they managed to seize most of the city, and have already rallied many police officers and soldiers on their side. Many deserters from the police and army has also reappeared on the lines of the Vaps Movement. With no other choice, Konstantin Päts have fleed the country."
estonia.18.a: "Päts' Estonia is Slipping"

estonia.19.t: "Artur Sirk Declares A New Government"
estonia.19.d: "The tyrannical rule of Konstantin Päts have come to an end. Today, we see a new morining in Estonia. One where the Vaps Movement can form the country to the better. Already, former loyalists to Päts have either retired or deserted to our ranks, with even Johan Laidoner, the commander in chief reluctantly turning his back on the former government. Today, Estonia can look forward!"
estonia.19.a: "A New Estonia Awaits"

estonia.20.t: "The London Crash Reaches Estonia"
estonia.20.d: "Recently, the London Stock Market have experienced an economic crash, bringing down the British economy. This has, in return, spread across the world, with our time coming now. As agricultural exports decreases and runs upon our own banks are happening, Estonia seems to slip into this economic depression as well."
estonia.20.a: "That's Unfortunate.."

estonia.21.t: "Recovery on the Horizon"
estonia.21.d: "Steps have now been made by our government to mediate for the effects of the London Stock Market Crash. We are now beginning to see a return to a more normalized situation. While the effects will still haunt us a bit longer, at least we are on the way to a full recovery."
estonia.21.a: "Estonia Will Prevail!"

estonia.22.t: "The [GetYear] Parliamentary Election"
estonia.22.d: "With the introduction of the new constitution, it is natural for us to hold a new election. While opposition parties are still not allowed to be formed, independents have been allowed to compete without much opposition from the government. While the independents have been able to win about 40% of the vote, the ruling National Front for the Implementation of the Constitution have won a 3/4 majority in the parliament. With this result, Konstantin Päts is close to be assured his power."
estonia.22.a: "I Love Democracy.."

estonia.100.t: "Johan Laidoner and His Men"
estonia.100.d: "No single person can rule alone, and this is a fact general Johan Laidoner knows. If he shall be able to hold onto power, he must be at least known with the art of diplomacy. Today, the general and now leader of Estonia met with generals of the Estonian army. With some of them still loyal to the regime of Konstantin Päts, it was necessary to get them to our side. Luckily, Laidoner is met by reasonable men, with most of them seeing how the wind is blowing."
estonia.100.a: "Same Time Next Week?"

estonia.101.t: "The Trial of Konstantin Päts"
estonia.101.d: "Former State Elder Konstantin Päts was today trialed for undermining the security of Estonia. While many still defend him, calling these mare accusations, with the judge now sentencing him for these crimes, we hope people are now seeing reason. Of course, the judge himself is one that we have managed to buy the loyalty of, but that is just a minor detail."
estonia.101.a: "Justice is Served"

estonia.102.t: "Revival of the Textile Industry"
estonia.102.d: "After both the Great War and the London Crash, the Estonian textile industry have been close to dead. With little exports and the consumer market in freeze, there have been little sale of textile products in and from Estonia. Now, with the introduction of private intensives and bailouts, the Estonian government is willing to see the revival of certain industries, even with a redirection of their focus. Hopefully, we will see improvement on this area."
estonia.102.a: "Industry is Good for Economy"

estonia.103.t: "For the Implementation of the Constitution"
estonia.103.d: "With the Third Constitution of Estonia now in its starting phase, it will be fit to reorganize the Patriotic League into an enlarged bloc, the National Front for the Implementation of the Constitution. With the Patriotic League often being affiliated with the most authoritarian bits of the Era of Silence, this might make people see that we are on the road to a better future."
estonia.103.a: "Let Us Unite Under the New Constitution"

estonia.104.t: "The Vaps Pacified"
estonia.104.d: "Finally, we have been able to pacify the Vaps Movement, the movement that have stood as a challenge towards the power of our government. Perhaps, with them finally respecting our authority, we might be able to work together later."
estonia.104.a: "Estonia is Growing Safer"

estonia.105.t: "The President and the Prime Minister"
estonia.105.d: "With the new constitution now going into effect, it is time for the State Elder to appoint a Prime Minister, to finally separate the office of the President and the Prime Minister. While Konstantin Päts continues as President, he have approached former State Elder and politician Kaarel Eenpalu for the task of Prime Minister. With this appointment, perhaps the so-called Era of Silence can become a bit less silent."
