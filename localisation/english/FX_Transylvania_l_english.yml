trans.1.t: "The Transylvanian Kingdom"
trans.1.d: "Coming into existance in 1921, the Transylvanian Kingdom was the result of a failiure between the Entente, Hungary, and Romania to decide who should have control over the Transylvanian region. Many proposals were made, but all fell through in the end. Eventually, an independant Transylvanian Kingdom was propped up as a'temporary' solution which would be revisited at a later date. This solution is now being seen across Europe as perminant, and it's unlikely that the Entente will want to involve themselves in the region again. \n\nThe future of Transylvania is uncertian, and it will take a steady hand to guide the nation through these turbulent years."

trans.2.t: "Hungarians offer us truce!"

trans.4.t: "Hungary demands Transylvania!"
