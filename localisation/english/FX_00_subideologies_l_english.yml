revolutionary_showaist_subtype: "Revolutionary Showaism"
revolutionary_showaist_subtype_desc: "§Y(Revolutionary Showaism)§!\n\nSince the present emperor ascended to the Chrysanthemum throne, the Japanese Empire has experienced a significant decline. The economy has reached a critical point, and the immigration of Koreans, along with the liberal impurity in Japanese politics, has only fueled the inspiration of right-wing extremists. Led by militarist advocates and the generals of the Imperial Armed Forces on Yamato Island, their only goal is to purify the island and secure it from the corrupted Western ideology once and for all.\n\nUnder the banner of Showa restoration, the far-right has embraced nationalistic and other right-wing ideas from Europe, but with a twist of socialism. This has led to the creation of Showaism, an ideology that aims to purify the Japanese Empire. Hashimoto Kingoro, a Japanese officer and one of Showaism's advocates, believes that the combination of revolutionary socialism, stratocracy, and nationalism will cleanse Japanese politics and bureaucracy of the corrupted liberalism. All of this will be done in the name of fairness and equality, based on his interpretation of socialism. The military will serve as the protector of the new reformed Japanese bureaucracy to ensure and safeguard the new Japan from another wave of corruption."
autocratic_socialist_subtype: "Autocratic Socialism"
autocratic_socialist_subtype_desc: "§Y(Autocratic Socialism)§!\n\nAutocratic Socialist regimes are highly authoritarian dictatorships that (at least on paper) adhere to socialist principles. They are notably varied, but can usually be seen with some form of command economy, emphasis on militarism, are often nationalist or use patriotism as a tool of the state, and are frequently at odds with more mainline Charter Totalists. While their commitment to Socialist revolutionary principles is usually questionable at best, these regimes still maintain socialism as the official state ideology, and go to lengths to paint their government red - even if the government is nothing short of a total dictatorship."
hardliner_bolshevism_subtype: "Hardliner Bolshevism"
hardliner_bolshevism_subtype_desc: "§Y(Hardliner Bolshevism)§!\n\nAs proud bearers of Leninist banners, Hardliner Bolshevist regimes are highly authoritarian dictatorships that (at least on paper) adhere to socialist principles. They are militarist, adhere to some form of nationalism or social-patriotism and usually practice state terror against all dissent. While their commitment to Socialist revolutionary principles is usually questionable at best, these regimes still maintain socialism as the official state ideology, and go to lengths to paint their government red - even if the government is nothing short of a total dictatorship."

socialist_security_state_subtype: "Socialist Security State"
socialist_security_state_subtype_desc: "§Y(Socialist Security State)§!\n\nWhile internal intelligence agencies aren't exclusive to any strain of ideology, Socialist Security concerns the organizations found in all so-called 'red' states. Called 'Securitatism' by people dismisive of such governments, the reason for their existence is a series of decisions that were meant to only broaden the reach of the state or party apparatus. When the agency overgrows their benefactors the chiefs of such polities reach for ultimate power with which they can monitor every happening inside their people's republic. Although most are only concerned by total control of any and all aspects of the nation, some do still maintain an aura of socialist policies or legitimate government as a cloak for their activities."

monsoc_subtype_desc: "§Y(Monarcho-Socialism)§!\n\nMonarcho-Socialism, along with its various subtypes such as Monarcho-Bolshevism, Monarcho-Communism, and others, seeks to coherently fuse the typically opposed systems of Socialism and Monarchism into one, unified form of government. Though the degree to which each monarch is dedicated to the Socialist system can vary greatly, from mere figureheads painted Red to monarchs fully dedicated to the Socialist cause, each system holds in common an adherence to the noble system of monarchism, and though this monarch is frequently only a facade for a more traditional Socialist government, their presence is key to the wider system. Under these Red monarchies, the journey to true Socialism is shepherded, and though each system is incredibly varied, they usually hold in common a more conservative or traditionalist outlook on social and societal issues."
leninism_subtype: "Leninism"
leninism_subtype_desc: "§Y(Leninism)§!\n\nLeninism is a political ideology developed by Vladimir Lenin, which advocates for the establishment of a revolutionary vanguard party to lead the working class in overthrowing capitalism. It emphasizes the need for a centralized and disciplined party structure, guided by Marxist principles, to seize and maintain state power on behalf of the working class.

anarchism_subtype: "Anarchism"
anarchism_subtype_desc: "§Y(Anarchism)§!\n\nAnarchism is a diverse body of politics that usually calls for the total or partial erosion of the State. Seeking to organize society along other means, either through voluntary cooperation or the free association between individuals and groups, these Socialists are oftentime seen as traitors to the Revolution by mainline Leftists. Still seeking a Socialist or Communist system, just without a wider state apparatus, Anarchists reject all or most positions of authority as they pursue total egalitarianism, equality, and freedom from all gods and masters."

fasci_utopian_socialism_subtype_desc: "§Y(Utopian Socialism)§!\n\nUtopian socialism is seen as an ideology that is misguided in its attempts to create a perfect society through centralized planning and government control, Libertarians generally believe in the importance of individual liberty and see the government as a potential threat to these values.\n\nOn the other hand, Utopian socialism often involves the idea of a collective ownership of the means of production and a planned economy, which may be seen as incompatible with individual freedom and the principles of a free market. Libertarians would argue that such an approach would restrain innovation, limit consumer choice, and result in inefficiencies and waste."
anarcho_syndicalism_subtype: "Anarcho-Syndicalism"
anarcho_syndicalism_subtype_desc: "§Y(Anarcho-Syndicalism)§!\n\nThe largest subset of mainline Orthodox Syndicalism, Anarcho-Syndicalism seeks to build a Syndicalist system - that is, a system organized around trade unions and employee organizations - within an Anarchist and stateless, or semi-stateless, framework. Seeking to abolish the wage system as well as Capitalist-fueled statism, Anarcho-Syndicalists believe that through solidarity, self-management, communization, direct action, and direct democracy, a true egalitarian paradise can be built for all to enjoy. Rejecting private property, hierarchies, and social stratification, Anarcho-Syndicalists will tear down the state to build their unionist utopias free from the apparent greed of statism."

agrarian_socialism_subtype: "Agrarian Socialism"
agrarian_socialism_subtype_desc: "§Y(Agrarian Socialism)§!\n\nAgrarian Socialism is the attempt to fuse Agrarian principles with Socialist doctrine. Championed by the likes of Zapata or the Narodniks, Agrarian Socialists are frequently more Conservative than their Leftist allies and push for a Socialist system that puts the peasantry and the farmers of the state above all other concerns. Common in less-developed or under-industrialized nations, Agrarian Socialism is frequently democratic, and usually calls for the creation of farming cooperatives, communes, or other cooperative organizational structures to better increase agricultural output and efficiency while progressing towards true Socialism."
bukharinist_subtype: "Bukharinism"
bukharinist_subtype_desc: "§Y(Bukharinism)§!\n\nBukharinism or Semi-Market Socialism is a set of ideas formulated by the Russian Bolshevik Nikolai Bukharin after the Civil War in Russia, which formed the basis of the program of his People's Socialist Party and the rationale for the so-called New Economic Policy.\n\nBukharin considered the main culprit for the failure of the Bolshevik Revolution in Russia and the loss of the Reds in the Civil War to be the ineffective policy of \"War communism\", which led to the complete alienation of the peasants from the Bolsheviks and economic crisis. Bukharin, however, in his writings, developed with economist Nikolai Kondratiev, suggested that socialism should be achieved gradually - and that state regulation of a mixed economy using planned and market mechanisms was necessary to achieve this goal. \"Socialism in the city - Capitalism in the countryside\" was how Bukharin characterized his program at the founding congress of the new party. In addition to the economic sphere, Bukharinism proposes a multiparty form of Soviet democracy, separation of powers, and Korenization - support for national minorities by promoting national human resources and limiting Russification."

Humanistic Capitalist societies progress towards economic prosperity with market economics as any other Capitalists do, but do so in a humane way that pays special attention to the needs, safety, health, and desires of the people, as well as to their social and even cultural and spiritual development, depending on the nation. Creating economically-fair financial systems guided by the invisible hand of the national government over any vague market force, Humanistic Capitalists seek to create a profitable utopia where any and all have a fair shot at achieving their wildest dreams."

However, the type of Christianity and the form of Socialism each specific example follows can vary greatly."

### Liberal

centrist_subtype_desc: "§Y(Centrism)§!\n\nDemocratic Centrism describes the political outlook that revolves around the maintaining of the set status quo. Though this status quo varies from nation to nation, Centrists rally around this middleground just the same, seeking to balance equality and hierarchy in their varied societies. Hated by both conservatives and extremists who see them as fence-sitters, Centrists rally around the proven status quo without faltering, resisting rapid reform and staunch traditionalism just the same as they pursue a happy medium between bickering parties for the greater good of their societies as they seek stability and consistency above all."

venizelism_subtype_desc: "§Y(Venizelism)§!\n\nVenizelism is one of the most significant political movements in Greece since the start of the 20th centrury. During the period of 1910 to 1922, when Greece was in a state of continuous military readiness, a new political mindset emerged, embodied by Eleftherios Venizelos, and was commonly referred to as Venizelism. It is difficult to define in what exactly this political ideology was, but in terms of the economy, Venizelism considered the Greek state as a lever for the expression and development of Hellenism. In other words, the Greek state had to pursue the integration of Hellenism beyond its borders and, with a unified national and state identity, claim its place in the then-modern world. This required not only institutional modernization to make the state efficient and reliable but also a general commitment to the idea of developing the nation's productive forces."

Differing from mainline Liberalism, Classical Liberals look more negatively on social policies, welfare systems, heavy taxation, and state involvement in the lives of its citizens, instead advocating for deregulation and decentralization, sharing some ideas with Liberal Conservatives, despite despising Conservative economics such as protectionism. Tied to the ‘original’ Liberals of the 19th Century, such as John Locke, Jean-Baptiste Say, Thomas Robert Malthus, and David Ricardo, Classical Liberalism is rooted in the ideas of Adam Smith, standing true to natural law, liberal progress, utilitarianism, and to the lessons learned during the rise of the Industrial Revolution and urbanization. From Hayek to Mises, Classical Liberals tow the line between the Center-Right and the Center-Left, seeking to bring about the ideas of the Enlightenment to their wayward shores."

Split between groups that support deregulation and the free market, and those that instead support economic interventionism, these groups are united in their pursuit of civil liberties and freedoms while championing Conservative social positions. Overall, Liberal Conservatism fuses Liberal Capitalism and Social Justice with Traditionalist views on society and life, and is exceedingly common in the Western World specifically, though it can be seen in practice across the globe."

Basing its programmes on Catholic social teaching and neo-Calvinism, Christian Democrats strive to create a free society in which traditional family values, social justice and good old fashioned patriotism will be respected. While most Christian Democratic parties don't exclude any denomination, some might choose to keep to a strictly anti-ecumenical position. Surprisingly to some, many advocates for Christian Democracy are rather left leaning in their views on the economy, advocating for models such as Distributism, based on Pope Leo XIII's 'Rerum novarum' encyclical. That position is of course not the only choice, with others preaching the Prosperity Gospel or upholding Christian Capitalism."

Ranging from bandit groups with a state to organized military startocracies to even military-backed republican governments or pure dictatorships, Warlordism has less to do with politics and more to do with a lack of clear borders and the ever-present and often chaotic nature of warfare.

autocratic_colonial_govt_subtype_desc: "§Y(Autocratic Colonial Government)§!\n\nColonial Governments are regimes appointed to manage an overlord’s various colonial holdings and possessions. These Colonial Regimes typically lack any concrete ideology, and instead simply serve as the bureaucracy that manages the colony. In this sense, these Colonial Regimes serve to do nothing but keep the gears of colonialism and imperialism running and profits flowing to the homeland. However, these Colonial Regimes will not hesitate to put down opposition to ensure the survival of the Colony, yet vary in how they go about this task as well as in how they organize their specific administrations and how loyal they are to the homeland."

pataut_warlordism_subtype_desc: "§Y(Autocratic Warlordism)§!\n\nWarlordism is hardly a uniform ideology by any stretch of the imagination. Instead, it describes the varied, incoherent, disorganized, and militarist nature of various warlord cliques around the world, and was named after the Warlord Period of China in which the term became popularized in the modern context. Ranging from bandit groups with a state to organized military startocracies to even military-backed republican governments or pure dictatorships, Warlordism has less to do with politics and more to do with a lack of clear borders and the ever-present and often chaotic nature of warfare. Warlordism is frequently a transitory state, and is usually just a stepping stone on the road to a more clearly defined political system, though some pure warlord states do exist."

These ideologies, often without theoretical foundations, put forward a strong man, often a military man, around whom reigns a strong cult of personality showing him most often as guardian of the Fatherland and Father of the people. With a strong populist character, these regimes create legitimacy by often implementing non-socialist forms of welfare for the people, and by relying on nationalism or patriotism. The economic policies of these regimes vary greatly, ranging from state-run economies to free markets in favor of foreign companies to timid protectionism."

Corporatocratic regimes value profit above all, and are known to have little regard for anything besides making a quick buck, though the level or even presence of ruthlessness can vary.

pataut_legionarism_subtype_desc: "§Y(Legionarism)§!\n\nFirst popularized by the Iron Guard of Romania, the Black Hundreds in Russia, and the ANI in Italy, Legionarism is a form of a highly religious and deeply militarist revolutionary nationalism. Rejecting entrenched political elites though sometimes tied to monarchism, Legionaries or Legionarists advocate for a national revolution that would end the old order and usher in the creation of a new, spiritually reborn society. Members of Legionary parties are often trained to act as militant martyrs in order to become closer to their Nation and God, though less extreme examples exist where Nationalism and Patriotism are expressed far more than martyrdom. In terms of economics, there is no one defined view, although Capitalism and Socialism are usually outright rejected as a corrupting, foreign force, with Corporatism, Right Syndicalism, or other forms of controlled economics largely being dominant. Though the emphasis on religion and zealotry widely differs, most Legionarists are devoutly Catholic or Christian, depending on the nation of origin, and all are deeply devoted to the jingoistic revitalization of their native country."

Between 1914 and 1922, the younger generation had to take part in the bloody struggle for Ukraine's independence. The war and the sacrifices that were made forced a large number of people to choose their destiny forever - to fight.

The economy has reached a critical point, and the immigration of Koreans, as well as liberal influences in Japanese politics, have only served to inspire right-wing extremists. Led by militarist advocates and the generals of the Imperial Armed Forces on Yamato Island, their only goal is to purify the island and rid it of any corrupted Western ideology once and for all.\n\nUnder the banner of Showa restoration, the far-right has embraced nationalistic and other right-wing ideas from Europe, but with a twist of socialism. This has led to the creation of Showaism, an ideology that seeks to purify the Japanese Empire. Nakano Seigo, a Japanese politician and one of Showaism's advocates, believes that the combination of corporatism and state socialism can help to reform the bureaucracy and rid it of foreign ideas. By making nationalism a central principle in policy-making and relying on trusted and fair overseers, the Japanese bureaucracy can be protected and purified.\n\nTo ensure the protection of the purity of the Japanese bureaucracy, a special government district will be created across Yamato Island. Feudalism will be adapted to some aspects of corporatism to ensure a balanced system of governance."

It follows that war is an inevitable thing, and wars between nations are eternal. Ukrainian nation, if it intends to enter the existing world order on an equal footing with the established ones, should have a hierarchy. At the head should be a leader, the vorzhd, then the elite or the order, under which the mass or the rabble lives.

The logos of Nichirenism must be followed by everyone, from the Emperor to bureaucrats and even common people. In the Japanese interpretation of the Lotus Sutra, it is believed that the Buddha is the only supreme being and even the center of the universe. Buddha's logos represent the supreme truth of the universe, and the Emperor will become the Marshal of the Holy Armed Forces and the viceroy of Buddha. He will guide the unification of Asia on the right and absolute path. After the world has been unified, the Lotus Sutra shall be taught in every corner of the world.\n\nLater, Nichirenism was further developed by Inoue Nissho, a preacher and former army spy who joined the Xinhai Revolution. He believed that he received the truth from Buddha while taking refuge in an abandoned temple and was motivated to study Nichiren Buddhism. He joined Chigaku's association in teaching Nichirenism and developed Pan-Asianism and Nichirenism together. He believed that Japan was the center of the world, the Sino-Indosphere, and that the unification of Asia was the same as the unification of the world.
