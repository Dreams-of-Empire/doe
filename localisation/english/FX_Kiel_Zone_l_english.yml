#### IDEAS ####

SHO_hamburg_legacy: "Spectre of the Hamburg Commune"
SHO_hamburg_legacy_desc: "The short-lived Collectivist revolt in Hamburg during 1927 was barely put down by the occupying Danish forces. The legacy of the Hamburg Commune lives on, 9 years later. Many socialist organizations still exist, awaiting a moment to rise up against their Danish oppressors once more."
SHO_nazbol_gang: "National Collectivism"
SHO_nazbol_gang_desc: "Hamburg has become the birthplace of the doctrine of National Collectivism. Encompassing a variation of Radical Nationalist and Collectivist ideals, the National Collectivists will likely be the ones to light the fires of revolution to overthrow the Danish Occupiers."
SHO_political_repression: "Political Repression"
SHO_political_repression_desc: "Despite that Democratic movements have achieved Democracy in Denmark itself, the Kiel Zone has remained under a Transitional Government for aproxmiately 6 years now. Many rights still have not been restored, and the Danish Transitional Government actively attempts to dismantle all Collectivist organziations before further reform."
