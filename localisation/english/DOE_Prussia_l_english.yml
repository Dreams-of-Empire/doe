PRS_republican_opposition: "Republican Opposition"
PRS_republican_opposition_desc: "Our mostly reactionary government only came into power to prevent a Vanguardist takeover, however it soon became clear that we leak any support within the Reichstag. With no majority, any vote of no confidence will any out cabinet. Only the far right parties support us while the social democrats and their allies have built a big tent opposition. We will need to swiftly deal with this or risk an end to our ambitions."
PRS_legacy_of_monarchy: "Legacy of the Monarchy"
PRS_legacy_of_monarchy_desc: "The shameful display of the monarchy during Great War and their out of touch policies has lead to the abolishment after 1912. Much of the misfortunes after the war was blamed on the Hohenzollern. Despite all that, there are still conservative circles and traditional minded people that long for the days of the Kings and remember the time before the war. Monarchist nostalgia is still very much a social factor and it doesn't help that the Republic has proven to be a unstable solution mostly favored by the lower class and the political left. The nation is divided and the legacy of the monarchy is one of the fault lines."
PRS_cabinet_of_barons: "Cabinet of Barons"
PRS_cabinet_of_barons_desc: "Almost all members of our cabinet are of a noble background, just like Papen himself, it is also no secret, that Papen holds monarchist symapthies. This has made our already unpopular government even less popular and mocking comments of the opposition. Even our conservative allies see this administration as nothing but a temporary compromise."
PRS_shame_defeat: "The Shame of Defeat"
PRS_shame_defeat_desc: "Even though our man fought valiantly in the Great War, we were defeated with enemies on all side. Prussia was so close to its goal but the war has broken what generations have built. The revolution at home was the final nail in the coffin of the old Prussia. Beset with heavy reparations, loss of land and a unstable republic, it is up to greater man to regain what is lost"
