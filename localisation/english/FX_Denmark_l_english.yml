#### Description ####
DEN_FUHRERREDUX_DESC: "The Danish Realm survived the Great War relatively unscathed, but it was the interwar period in which political strife took its toll on the Kingdom. The 1920s saw the Easter Crisis and the Abdication Crisis, two events which culminated in King Christian X breaking with constitutional norms in order to assert the sovreignity of Denmark and weaken the power and influence of the left-wing elements in the nation. After these political crises, the democracy and republicanism were established and after the first election the Social Democrats led the nation into the new decade. It remains to be seen where Denmark will go and how it will act in future crises."

###EVENTS###
denmark.1.t: "The Kingdom of Denmark"
denmark.1.d: "At the dawn of the 20th century, Denmark was entering an era of change, becoming a modern country. The power of the monarchy was questioned, and extended suffrage ensured the transition into a true democracy.\n\nWhen the dusk settled after the Great War, an opportunity to regain land was presented to the Danish nation. But the two plebiscites held in the northern parts of Schleswig, would also be the source for a crisis in Danish politics, when king Christian X dismissed the government when the government refused to declare new elections. With the support of the Armed Forces and the political right-wing, the king did not bow to this pressure. In the end, the crisis concluded with the Danish invasion of Flensburg and new elections.\n\nWhile the crisis ended with a win for the right-wing, it quickly developed in the other direction. Republican sentiments grew in the left-wing Social Democrats and Communists, as well as the popularity of these parties. After the establishment of the Norwegian Republic in 1927, the Social Democrats presented a proposal for a similar referendum on the monarchy. This was, however, voted down. But with the 1929 election, the socialist parties would gain a majority. This set off a second major crisis in modern Danish politics. The crisis would see the end of the reign of king Christian X, along with the establishment of a Republican party in Denmark and the start of the first Social Democratic government.\n\nWhile Denmark has mostly recovered from the crises of the 1920s, there does still harbor republican sentiments in the country. The rise of the Valkists in Germany has also triggered increased riots and protests in Flensburg and a radicalization of the politics of Southern Jylland. It is to see if Denmark will be able to come through future crises, despite these issues."
denmark.1.a: "Der er et yndigt land!"

denmark.2.t: "Grundlovsdagen"
denmark.2.d: "It is once more the Constitution Day here in Denmark. The day is of great importance, as it is celebrating the signing of the 1849 Constitution, that transitioned the country from an absolute monarchy to a constitutional monarchy. While the day is not an official national day, it is seen by one by many Danes."
denmark.2.a: "Long Live Denmark!"

denmark.4.t: "Republican Protests on the King's Birthday"
denmark.4.d: "With the celebration of the birthday of king Frederick IX, it has been met with an organized demonstation by supporters of the Republican party. While the celebrations continued as usual, the Republican movement has gained another chance to spread their propaganda in Denmark."
denmark.4.a: "A Bunch of Norwegian Puppets!"

denmark.5.t: "Anti-Danish Protests in Flensburg"
denmark.5.d: "Following the Constitution Day, a rise in protests against Denmark has intensified in Flensburg. Even in places where the German Valkists is a minority, there have been some reports of anti-Denmark activities. While the events are not of good news, the police and military has a secured position in the city."
denmark.5.a: "Germans Being Germans, I Guess"

denmark.6.t: "The London Stock Market Crash"
denmark.6.d: "News about the London Stock Market Crash has arrived Denmark, and along with, the negative consequenses of the crash. With the Danish economy connected with the United Kingdom and France through trade and exports, this will be a bad omen for Denmark and it's people."
denmark.6.a: "Denmark Lies Battered"

denmark.7.t: "The Landting Election"
denmark.7.d: "The election to the Landting, the upper house of the Danish parliament, has arrived. Today thousands of Danes are voting on the electorates who is going to decide who is going to sit in the Landsting. While the election is going as planned, the newly arrived economic crisis have tarnished the popularity of the Social Democrats, leaving the government with a minority in this house. This will make it more difficult for our government to deal with the economic crisis, since we need the majority in both cambers."

With the city experiencing more unemployment and a harsher day to day life, along with a strong German nationalism, many people have made the decision to commit crime and join valkist terror cells. With increased looting, assassination attempts and theft, the city is more dangerous than ever before."
denmark.10.a: "Flensburg is Burning.."

denmark.11.t: "The Army Takes Power in Flensburg"
denmark.11.d: "While Flensburg has been seen as a city under occupation by many, it still does have some local self-rule, on the line with other local communities in Denmark. For most of it's history under Danish rule, the city's representative council has been ruled by a broad coalition of Danish parties and regionalists, in order to keep out the pro-Germany parties. This made somewhat easy with the fact that many Germans don't vote.\n\nToday, the local self-rule of Flensburg was made into history, as the army took control over the city and the area around from the representative council. This in order to secure the area in the face of crisis."
denmark.11.a: "Democracy in Flensburg Has Faded"

denmark.12.t: "A Meeting With the Opposition?"
denmark.12.d: "With Denmark now being rocked by the economic crisis, it is our job to provide a plan for recovery in the country. With the Landsting election, however, this goal are seemingly less attainable without approaching the opposition parties.\n\nPrime Minister Thorvald Stauning has to decide if he is going to approach the opposition party Venstre to come to an agreement. While there seems to be an consensus that we should reach out to them, some of our supporters are a little unwilling to agree to right-wing demands."
denmark.12.a: "Let the Negotiations Begin!"
denmark.12.b: "No Compromice With the Right!"

denmark.13.t: "The Kanslergade Meeting"
denmark.13.d: "Delegates from both the government and the opposition party Venstre has now met in the home of Prime Minister Stauning in Kanslergade. Together, we hope to be able to come to an agreement on how we will tackle the economic crisis in Denmark.\n\nOur hope is to get the politicians from Venstre on an agreement by emphazizing how the crisis has harmed Danish agriculture and how our plan will help the Danish farmers. Hopefully, they will be willing to support our policies, if we give in for some of their policies."
denmark.13.a: "What Would it Take to Come to Agreement?"
denmark.13.b: "Don't Expect us to Compromice"

denmark.14.t: "The Success at Kanslergade"
denmark.14.d: "While the negotiations was not easy, we have finally come to an agreement with Venstre. While we had to compromice a bit, the core of our plan is still agreed on by the opposition party. With this, we hope to give a helping hand to the Danish people."
denmark.14.a: "Pleasure Doing Buisness With You"

denmark.15.t: "Venstre Leaves Kanslergade"
denmark.15.d: "When the delegates from Venstre understood that we had no intentions to accept any compromice, were they quick to become uncooperative. Holding on to their bourgeoisie pride, they have now left the negotiation table and Kanslergade. With this, the meeting is coming to an unfortunate end."
denmark.15.a: "What Now?"

denmark.16.t: "Towards a Snap Election"
denmark.16.d: "With the negotations a failure, the option has presented itself to call for a new election. After Prime Minister Stauning and King Frederick IX had discussed the topic, there seems to be an agreement that renewed confidence is better than the current one. There are also support for a new election among the opposition parties, some of whom has grown in popularity after the crisis."
denmark.16.a: "Let us See What We Get"

denmark.17.t: "The [GetYear] Folketing Election"
denmark.17.d: "After failed negotiations between the government and the opposition party Venstre, new elections has been called. There are many who campaigns on the seats in Folktinget, with even new forces present.\n\nThe governing Social Democrats can be able to hold on to power, with the numbers saying they are going to remain the biggest party. The most important question regarding them, is if they are going to reconsider who to form a coalition with. While allied to Radikale Venstre, there are many Social Democrats who sees it more natural to make a coalition with the Republicans in a left-wing Popular Front.\n\nThere are also the possibility that the right-wing opposition is able to gain a majority. There are a lot of former Social Democrat and Radikale Venstre voters who has expressed they are going to vote for Venstre or for the Conservatives.\n\nThe election might also make the situation worse, causing a political deadlock in Denmark. If that is going to happen, it will not be easy to say what path the Danish nation are going to take."

denmark.18.t: "The Coalition Question"
denmark.18.d: "While the election came out in the favour of Thorvald Stauning and the Social Democrats, the question of who to form a coalition with is still in the air. While many want us to continue our coalition with Radikale Venstre, there are equally as many in the party that wants us to form a coalition with the Republicans. It is up to Stauning and his ministers to decide."

denmark.19.t: "A Second Try at An Agreement"
denmark.19.d: "With the election providing a new change in Folktinget, some suggest that it has given us a new chance to seek a second agreement. While some of our supporters are negative towards this new attempt, there are those with the hope that we will succeed this time."

denmark.20.d: "With representatives from both the government and the opposition party Venstre once more in meeting.

denmark.21.t: "A Political Deadlock"
denmark.21.d: "With negotiations falling apart, the country has reached a political deadlock. With this, the opinion of the people will turn against us. It is to see how long this will last. Even if we should be able to come out of this, our reputation has recieved a battered image."
denmark.21.a: "I Know I am Terrible.."

denmark.22.t: "The Left-Wing Coalition"
denmark.22.d: "Ditching Radikale Venstre, Prime Minister Thorvald Stauning have now formed a coalition with the Republicans. This decision is looked on with horror by the political right-wing, seeing this as the start of the end of the Kingdom. While Stauning has assured the support of the Republicans in this, we will now need to reapproach Radikale Venstre, to get their support in our recovery plan."
denmark.22.a: "Stand up, Damned of the Earth!"

denmark.23.t: "Negotiations With Radikale Venstre"
denmark.23.d: "Today, it is delegates from Radikale Venstre who fills the seats of Venstre delegates at Kanslergade. Meeting with the new coalition government, we have met to secure the support for our plan to recovery in Landstinget. It will most likely not take much for our former coalition partner to agree on this."
denmark.23.a: "It is a Compromice Worthy to Take"

denmark.24.t: "Negotiations Successful"
denmark.24.d: "The Kanslergade negotiations between the government and Radikale Venstre has turned out to be a success. With a majority assured in both chambers of the Danish parliament, we can finally do our plan to recover the Danish economy. Our coalition partner, the Republicans, are profiling themselves as the saivors of social democracy, expecting that this will lead to a Danish Republic."

denmark.25.t: "The Fall of Stauning's Government"
denmark.25.d: "With the victory of the right-wing in the recent election to Folktinget, the government of Thorvald Stauning has fallen, losing the confidence of both chambers of the Danish parliament.\n\nWith this, a new government is set to take it's place. Venstre and the Conservatives have agreed to form a right-wing coalition government, carrying just enought seats in Folktinget to gain their confidence. The main question is who, between Venstre's Thomas Madsen-Mygdal and KF's John Christmas Møller, is going to lead this government."

denmark.25.b: "Christmas Møller Will Take the Wheel"

denmark.26.t: "Coalition With Dansk Samling?"
denmark.26.d: "With John Christmas Møller becoming Prime Minister of Denmark, there has been opened the question of allowing all the conservative movements in Denmark to be represented in this government. While our coalition partner in Venstre might have something against this, it might be smart for us to include Dansk Samling into our coalition. Formed before the snap election, this new party managed to gain a few seats in Folktinget. While it is not much, their inclusion might grant us bigger support in the political right-wing."
denmark.26.a: "Welcome to Our Coalition, Sørensen"
denmark.26.b: "We Can't Risk Our Coalition With Venstre"

denmark.27.t: "Negotiations With Radikale Venstre"
denmark.27.d: "Our right-wing government has the option to negotiate support from Radikale Venstre. While they are a party that has grown closer to the Social Democrats, their support would give us the support to perform our plan of recovery without opposition. There is also some that think we can do it without such an agreement."
denmark.27.a: "Let us Negotiate"
denmark.27.b: "We Manage it Ourselves"

denmark.28.t: "Negotiations Successful"
denmark.28.d: "The negotiations between our government and Radikale Venstre have proven fruitful. While compromising on some issues, our right-wing government has gained the support to perform our policies and recovery plan. What this has shown, is that the Social Democrats have not been able to govern through this crisis. Hopefully, Venstre and KF will be much more able to govern into a recovery for our economy."
denmark.28.a: "Social Democracy Has Failed"

denmark.30.t: "The Lyksborg Coup"
denmark.30.d: "It was an early morning when movement began to happen in the city of København. With the nation teared down by economic crisis, republican agitators and German riots, the political deadlock became the final drop.\n\nWith a great portion of the Danish army, a military coup has happened under the leadership of Victor Pürschel and his group of monarchist and pro-Christian X figures. With the failing prime minister under arrest, a new leadership has taken command in Denmark."
denmark.30.a: "Denmark is Free From the Dreaded Politicians!"

denmark.31.t: "Portions of the Navy Deserts"
denmark.31.d: "With the Lyksborg Group consisting for the most part by monarchists, conservatives and army figures, this leaves out many servicemen active in the navy. The news of the coup has now caused many seamen and some naval commanders to desert from duty. Some of them have even sailed of with ships from the Navy.\n\nWhile these news are bad for Denmark and our government, the worse part is that the former king, Frederick IX, have declared his support to his fellow naval comrades, causing a rift in the relationship between father and son. This is an issue that needs to be taken care of quickly."
denmark.31.a: "We Will Regain Their Trust"

denmark.32.t: "Anti-Monarchist Protests"
denmark.32.d: "While the Lyksborg Group have managed to coup the democratic institutions of Denmark, establishing a new monarchist government, it has not been well recieved by the working class in Denmark. With workers influenced by socialist and republican demagogues, they have moved onto the streets to protest our rule. If we are not able to pacify the socialist threat, these protests might evolve into a Danish revolution."
denmark.32.a: "Socialist Parasites!"

denmark.33.t: "The Danish Revolution"
denmark.33.d: "With weeks, even months of protests in the street, it has eventually evolved into an armed insurection against the Lyksborg Group and the monarchy. With continued problems haunting Denmark, the revolutionaries has seen it as enought.\n\nWith members of the armed forces in collaboration with the revolutionaries, they managed to overrun the Lyksborg Group and the Pürschel government. With the revolutionaries in control of the country, the reactionaries has been left to flee from our shores."
denmark.33.a: "Workers of Denmark, Unite!"

denmark.34.t: "Reactionary Opposition is Forming"
denmark.34.d: "The Republican Revolution has not been welcomed by all portion of Danish society. Still, there are many supporters of the Lyksborg Group and the reactionary monarchy. There are still these loyalties present through bourgeoisie structures like the army and the big farmers.\n\nThe fastest growing opposition however, is the one faced by the Danish National Party and other nationalist groups in Denmark. There are also a suspected connection between these far-right groups and the Valkist leadership in Germany. We need to stand at guard."
denmark.34.a: "Damned Reactionary Scum!"

denmark.35.t: "An Opportunity in Denmark"
denmark.35.d: "The Republican Revolution in Denmark might prove a danger for the advance of Valkism. These forces are seemingly hostile, or at least uncooperative, to our government and to Germany.\n\nHowever, there are still hope for Denmark. The Revolution have itself caused a Reaction from the Danish people, in the form of opposition groups. Among these are the Danish National Party one that is seemingly open to cooperate with the German people. While they are a bit too weak to cause any counter-revolution, we could help them with funding and support."
denmark.35.a: "We Need to Help Them"
denmark.35.b: "No, It Will Cause Further Tentions"

denmark.36.t: "The National Party Organize an Uprising"
denmark.36.d: "Rumors have come in that many right-wing figures are beginning to form an organized resistance against our government, under the leadership of the Danish National Party. The party seems to have become a rallying point for both members of establishment parties, far-right figures and reactionary military generals. All united in opposition to us.\n\nOur sources have now recently picked up signs of the organization of a nationalist and reactionary uprising in rural towns, along with terror attacks on Republican structures. Whatever it is, something is going on in Denmark."
denmark.36.a: "Smells Like an Uprising"

denmark.37.t: "March on Kobenhagen"
denmark.37.d: "In the early morinings, the silence was disturbed by gunfire and marching men. When the sun rose, it was clear that a march on Kobenhagen was in action. Armed members of the National Party, along with military units and monarchists marched united against the Republican government, armed with German rifles. With the Republicans being unable to take action against these groups, they are doomed to fail.\n\nThe fall of Kobenhagen to the rule of the Danish National Party correlated with German troops marching into the city of Flensburg, with many Germans in the city celebrating this liberation. As the new leadership of Denmark, we welcome that they have lifted the burden of handling the city, even if it might alienate some of our supporters. Today, a new era for Denmark has begun!"
denmark.37.a: "Danmark For Det Danske Folk!"

denmark.38.t: "Denmark Joins Stahlpakt"
denmark.38.d: "With all that Germany has helped the Danish people to get rid of the Republican Socialists, it is justified for us to join their alliance and their fight against the Socialist east and the Corrupt west. Together, Denmark and Germany will become partners and allies in the new world order. No longer will the past hold us away from our collaboration with Germany."
denmark.38.a: "Long Live Stahlpakt!"

denmark.39.t: "Denmark Joins Our Sphere"
denmark.39.d: "Our support to the Danish National Party, along with the failure of the revolutionaries in Denmark, has come out in our favor. With the socialists being dethroned, Denmark has repaid our support through joining the Stahlpakt and giving us back Flensburg. This is certainly a day to celebrate!"
denmark.39.a: "Excellent!"

denmark.40.t: "The Diarchy of the Republic"
denmark.40.d: "The Danish Revolution has been successful, there is still work to do. While the Republicans and the Communists have been on friendly terms before, during and right after the Revolution, this relationship might now sour. With the two parties differing on how Denmark is to run. The Republicans want a Danish Republic with democratic elections, while the Communists want a Socialist Republic under one-party rule.\n\nEffectivly, Denmark is ruled by a diarchy made up of the leaders of the two political factions. While the two parties still agree on some issues, the wishes to push Denmark one way or another might see a potential end to the Diarchy. It is to see who stands at top then."

denmark.40.b: "The Revolution is Under Threat!"

denmark.41.t: "The Communists Seizes Control"

denmark.41.a: "Rise, Workers of Denmark!"

denmark.42.t: "The Power Struggle Continues"
denmark.42.d: "Neither the Communists nor the Republicans have been able to sideline the opposing faction. With disagreements still being present between Republicans and Communists, and with both faction no less powerful than the other, this will make Denmark politically stuck. This might damage both factions and their reputation in the country."

denmark.66.t: "German Victory in Flensburg Plebiscite"
denmark.66.d: "The Flensburg Plebiscite has become one of the closest plebiscites in the history of the region. While the Pro-German side had an early lead in the campaign, following the campaigning, the lead shrinked in. Since this is quite a close plebiscite, the counting has taken longer time than anticipated, but the result is now coming in.\n\nWith just 173 more votes, the Pro-German camp has been victorious. Even if they got just below 50% of all casted votes, with some casted votes being declared invalid, they managed to have just more than the opposition. But while it looks like a German win, there is some rumors that there where fraud. We can still win this plebiscite if we play on the aligations of fraud.

Generally nationalistic and violent in nature, we might face another uprising from them in the near future."

The Danish Garrisons in the city are having difficulty keeping the riots contained. Waiting the riots our and then arresting the agitators would be the safest solution to this mess, however solving this with force would allow us to stop these riots without having to deal with damages afterwards... Although, it's a possibility that the citizens will respond negatively to force."
denmark.302.d: "Our attempts at containing the riots have failed, we've been incapable of enforcing the curfews and have simply been strained for manpower when it came to ending the riots with force. What's worse, is that riots have also started in Kiel, also with their backbone being the National-Collectivists. The severity of these riots might become uncontrollable soon."
denmark.303.d: "With riots largely being calmed by us relenting and liberalizing, we're faced with the first Election of Schleswig Holstein. We will no longer be an occupation zone going forward, we will be a Liberal-Democratic Parliamentary Republic.\n\nNonetheless, we're faced with the first election of Schleswig-Holstein. Only a number of selected parties have been permitted to participate in the Election, but the most popular of these parties seems to be the SP, FV & KP."
denmark.304.d: "All we've done is feed the flames. Rioting has only got worse in the recent days, and has reached further than simply the urban regions of our nation, and has even spread as far as Flensburg!\n\nOur Garrisons have largely been overwhelmed by rioters, some conscripts have even joined them. The little influence we have left here is in remote countryside locations, and given that the National-Collectivists have seized various Armouries, it's likely that this revolt may soon be armed."
denmark.305.d: "The Danish Transitional Government has collapsed! National-Collectivist forces and other Socialist revolutionaries have joined forces and organized a handful of combat units using seized weaponry. Shortly after, they were able to drive Danish Garrisons out of the country with little resistance.\n\nAs the National-Collectivists and other Socialists are assembling a 'Second Hamburg Commune', it seems that the Transitional Government has entirely disappeared in place of the Hamburg Commune."
denmark.306.d: "The damned Collectivists in the Kiel Zone have thrown our occupying forces out and have proclaimed the Second Hamburg Commune! Shall we crush this upstart again? Or shall we let them go?"
denmark.307.d: "Otto Stasser, a popular politician in Das Deutches Reich, has arrived a few days ago. He has expressed a large passion for the ideology of National-Collectivism, however he is a former Valkist.\n\nNonetheless, he seems to be very fiscally adept and is very administratively experienced. How shall we go about this?"
denmark.308.d: "The Danish oppressors lie defeated before us, our Militias are marching through our conquered territories bearing the flag of the Commune.\n\nA monumental day, now that we've successfully secured our independence, we can turn our gazes to other locations. We could even perhaps claim to be the legitimate German nation, but that would undoubtedly ruin relations with the Valkists."
denmark.309.d: "The German Commune has sent a formal request to join the Third Internationale, likely due to a lack of any allies in their region. They seem to be a future target for Germany, which may bring us into war with them in the future. Shall we accept?"
denmark.310.d: "The Soviets have rejected our offer to join the Third Internationale!"
denmark.311.d: "Otto Strasser, a former German Valkist, has arrived in our Nation. He wasted no time in pledging his allegiance to the National-Collectivist cause, and quickly denounced Valkism in support of National-Collectivism. As unfortunate as it may be, he seems to be doing a good job at attracting supporters."
denmark.312.d: "The Danish oppressors lie defeated before us, our Militias are marching through our liberated territories bearing the flag of the Commune.\n\nA monumental day, now that we've successfully secured our independence, we can turn our gazes to other locations! The First Hamburg Commune has been avenged!"
denmark.313.d: "The Hamburg Commune has offered a 'peace with honour' of sorts, they demand that we recognize their independence and they will grant us peace in return, without any territorial concessions from Denmark herself."
denmark.314.d: "The Hamburg Commune has put forward a 'peace with vengeance' demand. If we install a collaborationist regime, they are willing to cease military campaigns in our nation."
denmark.315.d: "The Danish have been unwilling to accept any of our terms, and we have been unwilling to make any changes to our list of demands. The talks quickly turned hostile, and no peace was reached."

The life of Frederick has not been all calm. His royal mission to secure his succession have seen many considerations and a failed engagement. It was first in 1935 that Frederick would wed, calming the people who wanted a future for the Danish monarchy. One of Frederick's biggest change in life is his assention to the throne through the Abdication Crisis, a move that alienated both hard line monarchists and radical republicans, but secured peace and continuation for the monarchy.\n\nFrederick himself is one at ods with the tradition of his father, former King Christian X.

POLITICS_CHRISTIAN_X_DESC: "King Christian X is the current King of Denmark. Born in 1870, Christian is the grandson to the long-reigning Christian IX, the "father-in-law of Europe". Growing up in the 19th century, King Christian became king in an era of modern social change in Danish society, with the ideas of constitutionalism and democracy. This became a counter to Christian, who is described as an authoritarian and one who stressed the importance of the monarch's power. His use of power, would however lead to his fall from it during the Abdication Crisis. Since then, Christian X have lived his life as an ex-monarch in Denmark, with his son taking his role.\n\nWhile Christian was officially no longer a monarch, he still had support among conservatives and monarchists in Denmark, many of whom saw the abdication as a coup from the Social Democrats. With an alliance of military figures and conservatives, they finally managed to seize power, bringing the de-throned Christian X into power yet again."

Since 1932, Larsen have led the Communist Party of Denmark, and has now finally become the leader of a socialist republic in Denmark. Considered to be on the moderate end of the party, Larsen, while supportive of the Soviet Union and Socialism, is not afraid to make a stand against authoritarian and anti-working class actions.\n\nAfter the revolution, Aksel Larsen managed to gain influence and power, disempowering the Republican Party. With him now at the head of the country, it is to remain what direction he will steer the country towards.\n\n§RSocialist§!"

Some of whom joined the Communist Party, while Fog became involved in the socialist wing of the Social Democrats. In 1929, Fog was among those who left the Social Democrats in opposition to the party's support of King Frederick IX, and joined the Republican Party.\n\nIncreasingly becoming a leading member of the Republicans, Fog was central in the overthrow of the Lyksborg group and the monarchy. While having to contain the influence of the Communists, it is to see if Fog is able to lead Denmark towards a new democratic society.\n\n§RRepublican§!"

With the support of Germany at his back, Lembcke hopes to lead Denmark to a greater glory.\n\n§WNationalist§!"
