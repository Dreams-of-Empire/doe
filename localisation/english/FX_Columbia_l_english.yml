CLB_whitepeace_nid: "Propose Peace to @SNR §Y[SNR.GetNameDef]§!"

### Ideas
CLB_enemies_on_all_sides: "Enemies On All Sides"
CLB_enemies_on_all_sides_desc: "Located in the Midwest of America, the Commonwealth of Columbia is a lone bastion of populism and true Americanism in a raging storm of conflict. Be it the Mexican snakes to our South, the British to our North and West or the Federalists and Fordists to our East, the Commonwealth truly is surrounded on all sides. Despite this, we know one thing they don't. We have the Lord God on our side, and they but the Devil to keep them company."   
CLB_beginings_of_commonwealth: "Beginnings of the Commonwealth"
CLB_beginings_of_commonwealth_desc: "Even as we begin to formalize our state, Pelley's grand economic vision for America, dubbed the Christian Commonwealth, has begun to be implemented throughout the Midwest. The Commonwealth itself is a vast overhaul of the entire American economy into a hybrid system. In this system, private businesses still exist, but they are all subservient to and part of the Commonwealth Corporation. Furthermore all banks have begun to absorbed into a Central Treasury Bank which will be responsible for distributing credit. Just only just beginning to be implemented, the Commonwealth is already beginning to have the desired effect, with a reported 7% decree in those who fit in Pelley's definition of Poverty."
CLB_the_ward_system: "The “Ward“ System"
CLB_the_ward_system_desc: "One of Pelley's most controversial policies, the Ward system functions as what many have called a form of modern slavery. In a nutshell,   those Americans identified as most impoverished (particularly Appalachian whites, deep southern blacks and Mexican immigrants) become Wards of the state and are brought under its care. However, Pelley identifies these elements as the most unproductive in society and  denies them full Commonwealth benefits, relegating them to largely labor jobs. In theory the system will be used to educate these peoples and ensure they can enter the Commonwealths workforce on an equal footing. In reality, the system has fallen under the sway of the Allenites, who abuse it, using the labor army it creates to indeed build up the Commonwealth, but at a tremendous human cost. Caring little for the Wards, the Allenites drive them in way that would make even the most harsh slave driver blush. The status of just what to do with the Wards, wither to reform the system, end it completely or simply maintain it's current implementation is one of the most divisive questions currently facing the Christian Party."   
CLB_democracy_in_limbo: "Democracy in Limbo"
CLB_democracy_in_limbo_desc: "Despite long term plans and promises to keep and even expand democracy and democratic rights, since it's formation a short time ago, Pelley's Commonwealth as of yet failed to live up to his word. Perhaps attempting to placate the Allenites or to drum up his status as the 'American Dressler,' Pelley has yet to formalize anything that even vaguely resembles democracy within his new state. Curiously, when he's pressed hard enough by the press, he still claims total loyalty the Constitution, only claiming that it needs to amended to include referendum voting on legislation. Regardless, both the various nonChristian Party political groups that exist within the Commonwealth and the people themselves wait for the time when Pelley will make true to his word, and creates a true democratic paradise here in the Midwest."
CLB_spliting_at_seems: "Spliting at the Seems"
CLB_spliting_at_seems_desc: "Be it Norris' Progressives, Coughlin and Townsend's Unionists, Smith's America Firsters or even our Allenite “allies“ within the Christian Party itself, it is clear to all that Columbia is on the verge of collapsing in on itself. To save the nation, we must take drastic action. Should we fail, §Rthe results would be bloody indeed...§!"

### leader bios
POLITICS_WILLLIAM_DUDLEY_PELLEY_DESC: "At age thirty-nine William Pelley was a rather unimaginative Hollywood screenwriter and journalist. His past adventures mostly consisting of visiting Russia and absorbing anti-Semitic pamphlets. By the time of his founding the Silver Legion in 1933, Pelley had cultivated his unique ideology, combining spiritualism, democracy, and faith. With Pelley's more eccentric views being reserved for trusted allies only. As America surrendered nearly a third of her land to the Mexican menace, Pelley knew the time had finally come to bring his own brand of revival to the United States. Using his connections in various Midwestern populist and progressive moments as well as keen use of the Sliver Legion, Pelley was able to carve out a sizable chunk of America for himself and his allies. Now in power, Pelley has begun at last to implement his vision for a holy and truly free America, however his rule is still far from stable. Be it his radical allies in the Allenite faction of the Christian Party, the various other populist and progressive parties within the Midwest, Pelley has his work cut out for him. If he is able to remain at the head of the Columbia or if he fails to keep the disparaging factions united remains to be seen."
