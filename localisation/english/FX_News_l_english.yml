fxnews.48.d: "[This.GetNewspaperHeader]As civil unrest engulfed the British Isles following a disastrous several weeks of political turmoil, many believed the Empire on which the sun never set would soon find itself dissolved and confined to the dustbin of history.\n\nRumours from Britain have indicated that a charismatic officer of the British Army has stormed the Palace of Westminster with the assistance of military units in the area after having been ordered to open fire on protestors on the streets of London. Already military units around the country have pledged allegiance to the new provisional Government and order has been restored - albeit brutally - to the streets of Britain."

As the crowd scattered from the gunman, it was discovered moments later that the King was dead, suffering a gun-shot wound to the chest which is believed to have pierced his heart.\n\nKing Edward's assassination has sent shockwaves throughout the political establishment in Britain.
