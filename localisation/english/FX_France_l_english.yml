#### History
FRA_FUHRERREDUX_DESC: "Victorious, but at what cost? Many Frenchmen found themselves asking this in the aftermath of the Great War. France had reclaimed its rightful land, and established a protectorate over the Rheinland to prevent the Germans from ever threatening La Patrie ever again. However as the 1930s come to an end, France's position in Europe and the world is increasingly threatened, with a hostile British Empire threatening France's colonies and a increasingly belligerent Soviet Union, but perhaps of the greatest concern is a resurgent Germany. France will need cunning, bravery, and excellent diplomacy to emerge from the coming storm unscathed."

#### Political Parties ####

FRA_vanguardist_party: "PFNC"
FRA_vanguardist_party_long: "Parti Français National Communiste                        §gA fringe political movement in France, the PFNC was formed during the February 1934 riots as a far-left split of Parti Populaire Français, which itself was a breakaway of the Parti Communiste Français. The party soon asserted itself as the most radical of the leftist parties in France, supporting racist doctrine refusing to cooperate with the government in any way. The party supports both Rattachism and pan-European nationalism, seeking to unify Europe under a single centralized government with the French at the top calling the shot. Despite being an extreme party, the PFNC is highly antagonistic towards the Parti Populaire Français and other radicals on both the left and right. The original leader of the PFNC, Marcel Déat, has shown to have highly radical opinions even by the standards of the party, and some have even branded him as a lover of Dressler's Germany. Should the PFNC come to power, France may find herself devoid of allies and with enemies on all sides.§!"
FRA_collectivist_party: "PCF"
FRA_collectivist_party_long: "Parti Communiste Français                                   §gThe Parti Communiste Français is the mainline Communist party presently active in France. Originally formed as a more radical offshoot of the SFIO in late 1920, the PCF quickly became the primary communist organization in France during the 20s and 30s, gaining great influence within the working class and having the power to call strikes at will, even if said strikes were few and far between. The PCF has affirmed itself as a revolutionary party and even included people such as Nguyen Sinh Cung, who was in fact one of its founding members. The party has steadily gained popularity throughout the early 19th Century, and polls show that support for the PCF is higher than ever due to the resurgent German power in the East and expanding Soviet influence across Europe. Maurice Thorez, the parties leader, is an outspoken communist with ties to the government and much political experience.Many believe that if leftism were to come to France, the PCF would be the vanguard and the one's taking charge of the political situation.§!"
FRA_libertarian_socialist_party: "Anarchistes"
FRA_libertarian_socialist_party_long: "Mouvement Anarchiste Français                             §gA collection of Anarchists and libertarian socialist movements led by Sébastien Faure under a common banner, the Anarchistes wish to see a great degree of decentralization come to France and a peaceful, democratic transition to revolution. While the Anarchiste movement may be small in number and low in popularity, they may prove invaluable in the case of a leftist government coming to power in France, democratically or otherwise.§!"
FRA_social_democrat_party: "SFIO"
FRA_social_democrat_party_long: "Section Française de l'Internationale Ouvrière         §gThe SFIO was born out of a merger between the Socialist Party of France and the French Socialist party in 1905 under pressure of the Second Internationale, and quickly found themselves sandwiched between the radical working-class syndicalists and middle-class liberals under the banner of the Radical Party. The SFIO was weakened not long after their creation when members of the Confédération générale du travail refused to cooperate with the party due to them being seen as radicals. These members of the CGT would form the Parti républicain-socialiste in the years leading up to the Great War, but would find themselves unable to stay afloat whilst trying to uphold both socialist and reformist policies, and the party would be be destroyed in 1934 with many of its members rejoining the SFIO. The outbreak of the Great War saw futher divide in the party as members argued between pacifism and patriotism. The post-war domination of French politics by the Fédération Républicaine kept the SFIO out of the spotlight, but the upcoming elections may prove to be their greatest chance yet of achieving success.§!"
FRA_social_liberal_party: "PR"
FRA_social_liberal_party_long: "Parti Républicain, Radical et Radical-Socialiste     §gBorn shortly after the turn of the Century in 1901, the PR is the foremost of the radicalist democratic parties presently operating in France. Originally quite left leaning, the PR has gradually moved futher towards the center with the rising popularity of the SFIO capturing the hearts and minds of the workers and labourors of France. After the Great War, the PR participated in minor government roles whilst being constantly overshadowed by the FR-AD coalition government which dominated French politics during the 20s and 30s. Popular support for the PR has never been large, and they must work together with other larger parties in order to push their agenda, but a coalition government involving the PR would certainly be a drastic change from the status quo.§!"
FRA_market_liberal_party: "AD"
FRA_market_liberal_party_long: "Alliance Démocratique                                       §gCreated in 1901 as a splinter of the Parti Républicain, the AD was a large supporter of the Bloc des gauches from 1899 to 1906. The AD distinguished itself from the right by supporting the 1905 Seperation of State and Church Act, something which many of the right-leaning parties had opposed due to their pro-Catholic policies. The party was formalized in 1911 under the name "Parti Démocratique Républicain". The AD made a transition to the right in the years leading up to and including the Great War, and in 1919 they formed the Bloc National in cooperation with the Fédération Républicaine. This coalition proved to be highly successful, and the postwar economic boom that the French economy experienced further solidified their popularity with the French people. This "blue wave" was more beneficial to the FR than the AD, but both parties remained dominant in French politics up to 1936.§!"
FRA_social_conservative_party: "FR"
FRA_social_conservative_party_long: "Fédération Républicaine                                          §gThe FR was fromed in 1903 in an attempt to unite conservatives in France who opposed the Bloc des gauches as well as partially the defense of Jewish officer Alfred Dreyfus, the party made up the conservative bourgeoisie of France who were generally opposed to social reform and supportive of minor decentralization throughout the country. The formation of the Bloc National in 1919 was a breakthrough for the previously minor party, and they soon came to dominate the French elections all throughout the 1920s and 30s. Almost every single French Prime Minister during this time came from the FR, with only a select few belonging to the AD, leading to little social change taking place. This lack of change has gradually pushed more and more of the French people towards the PR, yet support for the Bloc National remains high. Some believe that it would take nothing short of a devestating scandal to shatter the FR's popularity.§!"
FRA_authoritarian_democrat_party: "PSF"
FRA_authoritarian_democrat_party_long: "Parti Social Français                                                 §gA nationalist French party in early 1936 and can trace its origins to the far-right political league known as the Croix-de-Feu, which was itself only founded in 1927. The Croix-de-Feu supported the ideas of François de La Rocque, which served as the league's ceremonial leader. The sitting government attempted to ban all of the leagues after the February 1934 riots, but due to the league's influences in the already right-leaning government, the act failed and the leagues were allowed to continue their operation unimpeded. The Croix-de-Feu's reorganization into an political party took place shortly after the attempt to ban it and the other leagues failed in late 1935, and by 1936 they had transformed themselves into the PSF. The transition from pressure league to political party saw them drift further from the radical far-right and more towards the moderate right, yet they still uphold nationalist and patriotic French values whilst upholding democratic traditions and being fiercely opposed to communism.§!"
FRA_paternal_autocrat_party: "Gouvernement militaire"
FRA_paternal_autocrat_party_long: "Gouvernement militaire                                           §gSupport for a military junta is limited to radicals within the military, and the only possibility of a military junta taking power would be in the event of total government collapse and the need for a powerful force to fill the power vacuum.§!"
FRA_national_populist_party: "PPF"
FRA_national_populist_party_long: "Parti Populaire Français                                          §gEasily the most radical of France's right-leaning parties, the PPF upholds extreme nationalism, racist rhetoric, and privatization of industries. The PPF was created mainly from members of the PCF who found a disdain for the PFNC's policies and were generally dissatisfied with the left's failure in recent decades. The PPF is outspokenly anti-communist and uses iconography and symbolism to gather support, most of which is based just North of Paris. The PPF has little support in the French political sphere, and not even the equally radial PFNC are willing to cooperate with the party. As such, it will take nothing more than a total collapse of not only the French government but the state itself for the PPF to assert their dominance at the top of the political food chain.§!"
FRA_valkist_party: "SF"
FRA_valkist_party_long: "Solidarité Française                                          §gFrance's only Valkist movement, the Solidarité Française have virtually no internal support outside of some Germans living in Alsace-Lorraine and the Sarre. Many in French politics believe that the SF are openly working against the French state in order to bring about a collaberationist regime which is submissive to Germany. The SF has no real centralized leadership and is only united in their unique ideology which differs greatly from all others on the spectrum.§!"

### Leader Descriptions
POLITICS_PAUL_REYNAUD_DESC: "Paul Reynaud made his first major appearance in French politics in 1919, Reynaud was elected as part of the Conservative 'Blue Horizon' Bloc. Quickly developing a reputation for being a Savvy politician, Reynaud soon clarified his allegiance as a member of the Fédération Républicaine. Quickly climbing ranks within the party due to his Militant nature in foreign policy, Reynaud rose to the position of the Vice-President of the FR. In 1925, Auguste Isaac resigned his position as President of the Fédération Républicaine and sought to appoint a Militant successor in order to strengthen the platform of the party. Reynaud was a natural candidate due to his popularity within the party and firm stance on foreign affiars. Under Reynaud's leadership, the Fédération Républicaine managed gathering the most votes and seats in both the 1928 & 1932 Elections. An extremely pragmatic man, Reynaud follows one doctrine in foreign policy; France has no Friends, only Interests."

fra.1.t: "The Third Republic"
fra.1.d: "The second French Empire came to an end in 1871 with their defeat in the Franco-Prussian war, and the Third Republic swiftly took its place. The French defeat in the Franco-Prussian war left them bitter and spiteful towards the Germans, and this feeling would last another 40 years before they were allowed their revenge on the fields of the Great War. \n\nWith the end of the world’s most devastating conflict in 1919, the French were quick to enforce harsh demands upon the German nation. Full responsibility for damages caused by the war and a seemingly insurmountable series of debt payments destroyed the German economy and helped to bring France back to their hegemonic status in Europe. These economic burdens placed upon Germany, as well as the allied occupation of the Ruhr and Rhineland, forced Germany to default on their debts, and the nation went bankrupt. \n\nWhen German reperation payments stopped coming in, the French were forced to invade the Rhineland region and set up an Inter-Allied joint commission to administer the region. Along with this invasion of the Rhineland, the Saarland was occupied directly by the French army, in direct opposition from the Italians, British, and Americans, who had all participated in the occupation of the Rhineland. With the cecession of German reperation payments in 1933, exploitation of both the Rhineland and Saarland increased dramatically, leading to the Saarland being incorperated into the French Republic as the Sarre department. \n\nBy 1936, the ruling Bloc National continues to dominate French politics, seemingly unaware of the resurgant German power."
fra.1.a: "Vive la France!"

fra.2.a: "This demands further investigation!"
###
fra.3.t: "The 1936 national budget"
fra.3.d: "The annual budget report has come in, determining what funds the government has available to allocate to the different ministries and government services. For the third year in a row, we have come up several million Francs short of our projected spending capacity, and nobody has been able to determine where these lost funds are going. This issue has raised several concerns of rampant and widespread corruption throughout the government that has gone unnoticed for the better part of the 1930's, and many are urging that a Special Investigatory Council be created in order to find the source of these missing funds."
fra.3.a: "We must get to the bottom of this debacle!"
###
fra.4.t: "The National Budget - Investigation of the Army"

The government is in chaos, and the Gendarmerie Nationale has been called in to restore order in the parliament and prevent the building from becoming a riot.

The documents will be presented both to parliament and the public in a few days time, and they will be officially ratified shortly after. \n\nThis radical change in French politics is sure to bring instability for a short period of time, but many are optimistic of a quick recovery and return to political dominance in Europe. \n\nThe eyes of the world are upon us, and international reaction will be devicive in securing legitimacy for the new state."

Lasting from 1870 to [GetYear], the Third Republic was one of the longest lasting French governments, but it appears that it simply could not withstand the political turmoil of the 20th Century, being brought to its knees in 1919 and not able to recover before the political and economic scandal along with the crippling effects of Black Wednesday finally broke the Republican institutions. \n\nThe new France is practically unrecognizable from the previous administration, as a unitary one-party state with an undemocratically elected leader. The hope is that this new government of national unity will be able to withstand the strains of the new, modern world, and defend France from the resurgent German dog to the East. \n\nThe citizens of Paris cheered when the new government was announced, and spirits across France are looking up as optimism is high for the future."

Now many generals are openly demanding Pétain's resignation and the election of a new candidate to head the French government. \n\nPétain himself is shocked at this revelation, and has stated that he has no intention of backing down to demands from his subordinates. However, support for Pétain's resignation is climbing quickly and he may soon be left with no other choice."

fra.15.d: "Despite our revocation of the legality of strikes in France, a group of working in La Rochelle have stopped showing up to work and have demanded increased safety regulations and a higher wage. This has presented somewhat of a crisis in our government, as accepting these demands would tarnish our name severly and cause a serious drop in our authority.

The first movie in the trilogy to not be adapted from a screenplay and instead based solely on a film script, though many believe that in the future the movie will be re-adaped to fit in with the other two plays on-stage. \n\nThe film is hailed as being a staple of cosmopolitan French culture, and has quickly peaked the charts for the year of 1936. The main points of criticism towards the film are its long run-time, and less-than-exciting storyline for the climax of a trilogy of films and plays. \n\nStill, Pagnol continues to be regarded as a genius not only of film, but other mediums such as poetry and drama. He is seen as one of the embodiments of French contemporary French culture, and his fans wait endlessly for his mind to produce yet another great story."

###
fra.17.t: "Manouvers along the Pas-de-Calais"
fra.17.d: "Ever since the Great War came to an end in 1919, French military staff have been scrutinizing every decision made throughout the course of the war and playing wargames to see what they could have done better. Several diffrent previaling schools of thought have taken hold, and the arguments nearly turned violent before the Chief of Army stepped in to mediate the situation. \n\nWhat followed were a series of live wargames in the Pas-de-Calais region of France, with one side representing Germany and the other representing France. What the officers found was that using conventional tactics, both armies were forced into a state of trench warfare within weeks of the simulated war beginning. A promising new "Guerre éclair" tactic showed many signs of success, involving a lightly armoured spearhead which would punch through the enemy lines before spreading out like a funnel, allowing allied soldiers to capture huge swaths of enemy troops and hostile land. Combined with an air offensive, it was believed that this new "Lightning War" could potentially turn the tide in France's favour during the next major continential war. \n\nIt was not soon after, however, that several officers found major faults with the plan. Fuel and supply shortages were rampant with this doctrine, and the risk of being cutoff from the main army was extremely high if the enemy force were able to break through the spearhead. It was for these reasons that the plan was essentially scrapped by the end of the wargames. \n\nWe may not have found our magical new doctrine, but the army has certainly learned a thing or two about fighting a modern, defensive war."
fra.17.a: "Guerre éclair, doesn't that mean something in German?"

fra.18.t: "The 1936 Tour de France"
fra.18.d: "The 30th edition of the Tour de France concluded today, as the riders crossed the finish line and ended the annual tradition. The top time was a blistering 142 hours and was achieved by the Belgian rider Sylvère Maes. This Tour de France differed from past races in that it was broken up into three seperate parts, and top three in each stage would recieve a boost to their time depending on which position they held at the end of each individual section. \n\nHenri Desgrange insisted that he conduct the race himself, despite having undergone kidney surgery only weeks prior to the start of the race. Still, he was determined to follow the race in a car full of cushions, causing quite the scene whenever he drove through a city full of spectators. After the second stage, Desgrange stopped and handed control of the race over to Jacques Goddet for the final third of the race. \n\nMany cheered on France's own Antonin Magne through the race, and he managed to achieve a respectable second place overall, nearly half an hour behind Sylvère Maes. \n\nWith the Tour de France over, the citizens go back to their daily lives, waiting in anticipation for next years race to begin."
fra.18.a: "How exciting, I can't wait for next year!"

fra.19.t: "Miners Strike in Normandy!"
fra.19.d: "A group of coal miners working around the city of Rouen ordered a limited strike, refusing to go to work and shutting down industry across the region. The local police were sent in to restore order and get the miners back to work, but this strike is seen by many as an example of the weakening power of our government. Sadly, there is not great deal that we can do to fix the situation, as the local government seems to have no intention of stamping the strike out, and the government has ushered us to act carefully lest the strike spread to other provinces."
fra.19.a: "What do you mean we can't just shoot them until they start working again?"

Louis was the inventor of the first practical headlights for automobiles, and created a profitable business manufactoring and selling them en masse to the public. Louis used much of the money he made from his headlight industry to spearhead the creation of new aircraft and systems for them, and he is credited for creating the first joystick and foot operated rudder pedal combination in early 1908. \n\nMany in both the aviation and automobile industry are deeply saddened by the passing of Louis Blériot, and his funeral is estimated to be attended by over a thousand wealthy businessmen and close associates of him."

She was also remembered for her several accounts of foreign politics during her life, and made several devisive writings criticizing Bismarck and his policy of German revanchism and unification."

The military has declared a junta in place of the democratic government in a seemingly desperate attempt to salvage the military situation and stall the German invasion. \n\nIt is unknown what the true intentions of this military government are, and many believe that this was in fact orchestrated by the far-right Action Française. Regardless, the new military government has directed all of the nations resoures towards the frontline, and for the time being the situation seems to have stabalized."

fra.23.d: "The war is over, and we has miraculously come out on top against our German foe. With the end of the war, the question of the ruling military junta was one in the minds of many Frenchmen who had endured the war under their military-driven leadership. This general discontent, along with army elements loyal to the Republic returning home en masse, has persuaded the military junta to step down and allow the democratic government to take back control.\n\nDuring the war, many of France's citizens turned to socialist ideals in the hopes of a brighter future after the war, and as such many are calling for the instilation of the SFIO to form a government with which to repair our shattered nation. Still, both liberal and conservatives alike remain popular within the minds of citizens, and the restoration of a traditional government may be what we need in order to bring about a new era of prosperity."

Many have declared these to be the final days of the Third Republic, and hope is fleeting. \n\nCharles De Gaulle, recently promoted to Brigadier General for his gallant actions during the early phases of the German invasion, has approached the faltering government with a most radical plan. For the past week he has been desperately drawing up plans for a complete evacuation of our military and political assets across the Mediterranean Sea to our holdings in Algeria so that we may continue the fight there. Little needs to be said of the ambition of this plan, and simply the idea of it has caused great divide in our already weakened government. [ROOT.GetLeader] has been given the unfortunate task of deciding whether or not to accept De Gaulle's plans, and no matter which he chooses many more Frenchmen will die and support for his party will be lost. \n\nGeneral De Gaulle has repeatedly stressed that this is the only way for us to defeat the German menace which ravages our land, and with the sound of battle drawing nearer, we are evidently out of time to ponder the outcome of either decision."
fra.24.a: "We must continue the fight, no matter how far we must flee..."
fra.24.b: "Nonsense, we have them on the back foot!"
###
fra.25.t: "Corruption in the Army"
fra.25.d: "The SIC revealed a layer of corruption and villiany within our officer corps, and many of our high-ranking officers seem to hold ties to the Action Française league. We cannot allow such rot within our army, and as such we must begin a series of public trials and ban them from military and political life. \n\nThis will be a long and difficult process, and our army will suffer as a result. However, once the trials are over our army will be far more organized and include more modern generals with new and ambitious ideas."
fra.25.a: "Let us hope the Germans remain distracted."
###
fra.26.t: "Trial of the Generals - First Phase"
fra.26.d: "As the army investigation and trials get fully under way, several generals have been found guilty of various levels of corruption and individual scandal. All of the Generals on trial will recieve punishments, but we can't afford to fire the entire lot of them at once, and as such we must choose a certain group to punish more harsh than the rest."
fra.26.a: "This will take a heavy toll on our military..."
###
fra.27.t: "Trial of the Generals - Second Phase"
fra.27.d: "The second phase of the military trial has begun, and already several high-ranking members of the military have been found guilty of corruption, bribery, and an assortment of other crimes against the state. The number of innocent generals in our army is dwindling fast, and our military is beginning to fall apart at the seams."
fra.27.a: "Lets hope this doesn't go on much longer"
###
fra.28.t: "Trial of the Generals - Final Phase"
fra.28.d: "The rotten stench of corruption and robbery has managed to seep into the very top of our military it seems, with naval, army, and air officers being forced to resign left and right at a staggering rate, our military has been absolutely crippled by this investigation, and we can only hope for a swift recovery."
fra.28.a: "Surely it can't get worse than this..."
###
fra.29.t: "Talented Military Minds"
fra.29.d: "Military colleges across France have been churning out young and spry officers with great effect. The damages to our military from the repeated trials are beginning to wear off, and within a couple of months our army will be more capable than ever."
fra.29.a: "Wonderful news to be sure!"
###
fra.30.t: "Talented Military Minds"
fra.30.d: "Military colleges across France have been churning out young and spry officers with great effect. The damages to our military from the repeated trials are beginning to wear off, and within a couple of months our army will be more capable than ever."
fra.30.a: "Wonderful news to be sure!"
###
fra.31.t: "Talented Military Minds"
fra.31.d: "Military colleges across France have been churning out young and spry officers with great effect. The damages to our military from the repeated trials are wearing off, and within a couple of months our army will be more capable than ever."
fra.31.a: "Wonderful news to be sure!"
###
fra.32.t: "Talented Military Minds"
fra.32.d: "Military colleges across France have been churning out young and spry officers with great effect. The damages to our military from the repeated trials are almost completely worn off, and within a couple of weeks our army will be more capable than ever."
fra.32.a: "Wonderful news to be sure!"
###
fra.33.t: "Seeds of a Revolution"
fra.33.d: "A situation seems to be developing in Southern France, a large group of industrial workers were seen parading through the strees of Toulouse sporting an all-red flag for the better part of the morning before marching on through the countryside, their numbers growing with each town they pass through. Local police have tried to stop the crowd and force them to disband but all efforts have proven to be ineffective. The government is unwilling to send in troops due to the crisis developing within the military and political scene in general, and any direct military intervention may rile up both the left and right political extremes in our nation. \n\nRegardless, this "Workers March" is gathering steam at an ever-growing rate, and while they are keeping to themselves in the South of France for now, there's no telling if or when they will change course and head straight for Paris."
fra.33.a: "Perhaps this is something we should keep an eye on."
fra.33.b: "We need not concern ourselves with a few disgruntled miners."
###
fra.34.t: "The Workers March reaches Bordeaux"
fra.34.d: "Yesterday we recieved a telegram from the local police in the city of Bordeaux outlining the extent of the Workers March and their presence in the city. There are apperently mass demonstrations calling for the abolition of the government and the start of new elections. While the majority seem to have relatively democratic demands, some groups are demanding the complete abolition of our republican government and the installation of a communist regime similar to that of the Soviet Union. These people, while small in number, are quickly gaining traction within the already disgruntled mob of citizenry. \n\nWe have been forced to order our divisions out of the Bordeaux region for the time being in an effort to avoid igniting the powder keg of a city, but with time they will surely die down."
fra.34.a: "Things are not looking well for us."
###
fra.35.t: "The Workers March reaches Poitou"
fra.35.d: "Reports from the city of Poitou have indicated that the Vanguard of the Workers March has entered Poitou, and the local police have been unable to control the gigantic crowd which has flooded into the city. The movement has once more swelled in numbers due to an influx of disgruntled citizens within the city joining their ranks. Several French generals have drawn up plans to forcefully disband this march using several of our experienced divisions currently stationed in Africa, however this idea has been completely blocked due to an unwillingness in the government to fire upon its own citizens and possibly incite another revolution in the nation. \n\nThe Workers March moves on in a generally Northward heading, and many political observers believe that they will dissipate when met with the Loire river and it's low-capacity bridges."
fra.35.a: "When will they stop?"
###
fra.36.t: "The Workers March crosses the Loire"
fra.36.d: "Against our hopes, and the beliefs of many of our advisors, the Workers March faced no issue crossing the Loire river, and have now proceeded to march even further Nrothward through many small towns and rural areas. Estimates put the volume of the crowd anywhere between 600 and 900 people, and growing constantly. Several recon divisions have been shadowing the March since they passed through La Rochelle, and a clearly defined group appears to be leading the entire march, most of which are wearing red attire and carrying around blood-red flags. It would seem that as time goes on, the March becomes more and more socialist in nature, with many of the participants joining in the singing of "La Internationale" on a daily basis. \n\nThe leadership of our government has become quite frightened, and several divisions have been placed both in and around Paris as a preventitive measure in case the March does reach the city, but many citizens are doubtful that they will be able to stop this march if it continues for much longer."
fra.36.a: "Things are getting dangerous!"
###
fra.37.t: "The Workers March reaches Normandy"
fra.37.d: "In a surprising event, the Workers March continued to head North after reaching Le Mans rather than turning Eastward towards Paris. It seems they are heading to Caen in order to further bolster their numbers, and their actions have put all of Paris on edge. There is a looming sense of dread hanging over the city, and many anxiously await the day when the dust cloud appears over the horizon and finally reaches the outskirts of the city. The crude barricades that the army has erected in the streets bring back memories of the Paris Commune"
fra.37.a: "They will be in Paris any day now!"
###
fra.38.t: "The Workers March reaches Paris"
fra.38.d: "It would appear our worst fears have finally been realized, the Workers March has reached Paris in full force, and have begun their push into the city center. Outposts lying in the rural areas outside of the city were quickly overrun by citizenry armed with both firearms and melee weapons, with a few posts even switching sides and joining the march. The East half of Paris is relatively untouched by the march due to the Seine River cutting the city in two, but the Arc de Triomphe has already been overrun and a red banner has been hoisted over the monument. The Palais Bourbon is within spitting distance of the now-rebel army, and many fear that a Second Paris Commune may soon become a reality, and the French military is finding it harder and harder to keep the rebels at bay without resorting to violence. There are confused screams flooding the streets, and few can tell friend from foe on ground level. \n\nShouting overtakes one of the alleyways as a barricade falls, and in a single moment of panic and confusion..."
fra.38.a: "§RWe had no other choice...§!"
###
fra.39.t: "The aftermath of Bloody Monday"
fra.39.d: "The stench of gunpowder lingers in the air, the smoke still billows from smoldering ruins outside the city, and blood still stains the roads leading to the Eiffel Tower. \n\n"Bloody Monday" the people of Paris are calling it, and rarely has there ever been a more apt name for an event in history. A heavy silence has lingered over the city this past week, and many are waiting to see what the now murderous government will do in response to this tragedy. The fallen citizens of Paris have become Martyrs for both the extreme left and right, claiming that our government is no longer fit to rule the people nor the state over which it presides. There are talks of a second, organized Workers March in Marseille, and several high-ranking generals"
fra.39.a: "What does this mean for our Republic?"
###
fra.40.t: "Rise of the PSOP"
fra.40.d: "Marceau Pivert, an exiled left-wing member of the SFIO, has founded a new party along Libertarian and Marxist lines known as the "Workers and Peasants' Socialist Party". This party has little support outside of its already fringe movement, and they have found little support from either the SFIO or the PCF, and some believe the party itself may soon splinter and see its members scatter. Still, the PSOP has become a member of the International Revolutionary Marxist Centre, and have been appealing to disenfranchized and disillisioned members of both the SFIO and PCF, and the possibility remains that they may soon gain traction as a popular midddle-ground party for the socialist movement in France."
fra.40.a: "This does not concern us."
###
fra.41.t: "France proposes guaranteeing Austrian independence"
fra.41.d: "Our French allies have been keeping a close eye on Germany and their expansionist attitude, they have approached us with a request that we both officially and unilaterally declare our support in Austria's favour should the Germans come knocking on Vienna's door. This diplomatic guarantee may be what we need in order to curb Germany's aggressive new government, however we may find ourselves in an unfortunate war with the German war machine for the second time in 40 years. \n\nWe must consider our choices carefully."
fra.41.a: "We will stand by the Austrians"
fra.41.b: "The Austrians are on their own"
###
fra.42.t: "The Entente Backs Our Independence!"
fra.42.d: "We have recieved official word from Paris and Rome, both France and Italy have declared their full support for our independence from German rule. Both leading members of the Entente made sure to publicize this guarantee as much as possible as to catch Germany's attention with it. Hopefully this declaration will stave off any German attempts at undermining our independence and increase our ties with the Entente."
fra.42.a: "The Habsburgs may be gone, but our diplomatic prowess isn't!"
###
fra.43.t: "Italy refuses our offer!"
fra.43.d: "The Italian government has decided that they will not join us in guaranteeing Austria's independance and subsequently have stabbed us in the back diplomatically. Relations between us and the Italians have become strained and some are worried that this may once more split the Entente in two. The Austrians have become nervous from this diplomatic scuffle, and are asking that we be the sole protectors of their independence."
fra.43.a: "Fine, I'll do it myself"
fra.43.b: "The Austrians are of little consiquence anyway"
###
fra.44.t: "The Swiss Question"
fra.44.d: "The French have approached us officially with an interesting offer. They are offering to settle a truly critical territorial dispute between the Swiss and our two nations. There is a sizable Italian and French population living in the South and West of Switzerland respectively, and saving these Italians from the cruel and dictatorial Swiss government should be our top priority."
fra.44.a: "We agree to the French terms"
fra.44.b: "A war with the Swiss is not benificial at this time"
###
fra.45.t: "The Italians agree"
fra.45.d: "The Italian government has expressed their interest in annexing the Italian-population portions of Switzerland after we annex the Romandie region. We don't expect the Swiss to put up a fight against our combined might, but we should be prepared for war nonetheless."
fra.45.a: "Wonderful news"
###
fra.46.t: "The Italians decline"
fra.46.d: "The Italian government has expressed their desire not to enter into conflict with the Swiss in the name of rescuing their estranged population. Clearly the Italians do not care for their own people and as such have left us as the protectors of the Swiss Italians."
fra.46.a: "Fine, more land for us"
###
fra.47.t: "France and Italy demand our territory!"
fra.47.d: "A joint telegram from Paris and Rome has reached our capital today, and it would appear that it holds most unfortunate news. The radical French and Italian governments, having taken power not long ago, have decided it to be in their best interests to prey on their smaller neighbors. The French have demanded the Romandie region, a part of Switzerland inhabited largely by French-speaking Swiss citizens. The Italians on the other hand have demanded the Tessin region, a large border strip in which much of the population speaks an Italian dialect. \n\nThese demands clearly violate our territorial integrity, and our population is ready to fight at all costs. However, the best option may be to relent and live with the consequences of these actions."
fra.47.a: "Alas, we are powerless"
fra.47.b: "We are a nation of mountains, we will not back down so easily!"
###
fra.48.t: "France demands our territory!"
fra.48.d: "A telegram from Paris has reached our capital today, and it would appear that it holds most unfortunate news.

fra.48.b: "We are a nation of mountains, we will not back down so easily!"
###
fra.49.t: "The Swiss Have Surrendered"
fra.49.d: "Good news from Berne, the Swiss government has decided to surrender the region of Romandie over to us peacefully, and without a fight. The Swiss military has been evacuated froom the region and our divisions are crossing the border to quickly restore order to the confused citizens. \n\nWe expect the Italian government to place their own demands any day now..."
fra.49.a: "We grow more powerful by the day"
###
fra.50.t: "The Swiss Stand Defiant"
fra.50.d: "Sadly, the Swiss government appears to have been unable to grasp the gravity of this situation. They have stood defiant of our demands and instead chose to oppose our military and political might. Our officers are ready for a war, and our men are eager to seek glory on the battlefield once more. There are fears that the rugged Swiss terrain may bog our troops down and enter us into another long and protracted conflict, a scenario few are willing to consider."
fra.50.a: "To War!"
fra.50.b: "To War!"
fra.50.c: "We cannot afford such a costly war."
###
fra.51.t: "The Swiss Have Surrendered"
fra.51.d: "Good news from Berne, the Swiss government has decided to surrender the region of Romandie over to us peacefully, and without a fight. The Swiss military has been evacuated froom the region and our divisions are crossing the border to quickly restore order to the confused citizens."
fra.51.a: "We grow more powerful by the day"
###
fra.52.t: "The annexation of Tessin"
fra.52.d: "The French government has annexed the Romandie region, and shown the world how weak the Swiss really are. Now would be the perfect time to strike and annex the Tessin region into our own budding empire."
fra.52.a: "Send in the troops!"
###
fra.53.t: "The Romandie Conflict"
fra.53.d: "Tensions have skyrocketed these past few days on the Franco-Swiss border. Many around the world are holding their breath to see what we will do next, whether we will attack or back down to a nation which has stolen our people and defied our demands. The time has come to invade Switzerland, come hell or high water."
fra.53.t: "Rally the troops!"
###
fra.54.t: "Black Wednesday hits France!"
fra.54.d: "The economic downturn across the English Channel has finally struck us, and our shambled-together economic defenses were no match for the worlds largest economy collapsing in on itself. The value of the Franc has sank to a never-before-seen low, and it shows no sign of slowing down any time soon. Our economists are doing their best to devise plans to combat this depression, but the French economy will be undoubtedly suffer for months to come, if not more. \n\nOur colonial offices, which are deeply tied to the Metropolitan economy, have seen a near-total collapse of their fledgling economies. Our Indochinese colonies have requested a full bailout of their debts and our companies in French Africa have almost all filed for bankruptcy. \n\nIt is clear that something needs to be done quickly if we are to have any hope of recovering our economy in a timely manner."
fra.54.a: "This is a tragedy!"
fra.54.b: "Whatever will we do?"
fra.54.c: "This does not bode well..."
fra.54.e: "Something must be done!"
fra.54.f: "Can't we just catch a break?"
###
fra.55.t: "The Situation Improves"
fra.55.d: "Economic policies and initiatives taken by the government have led to a drastic improvement of our economic situation. The worst may finally be behind us and we will soon be back on track to prosperity."
fra.55.a: "Wonderful news!"
### Event fra.56 uses the same text as 55.
fra.57.t: "Economic Prosperity Returns"
fra.57.d: "The effects of Black Wednesday have finally subsided and prices across France have returned to stable levels. Few will soon forget the effects of this tragedy, and preventative measures have been in place to ensure something of this magnitude never happens again"
fra.57.a: "Is bread finally affordable again?"
###
fra.58.t: "The Occupation of the Canaries"
fra.58.d: "In the early morning hours of yesterday, a small strike force of French marines departed from Casablanca for the Canary Islands, presently held by the Spanish Falangists. The operation lasted a total of 16 hours, and began with the seizure of the the island of Fuerteventura and Gran Canaria. Intense fighting was reported on the island of Tenerife, and the city of Santa Cruz de Tenerife held out despite being entirely surrounded for several hours.\n\nBy midday, the capital city had fallen and the marines had moved onto the final three Western islands in the chain. Small pockets of resistance held out in the forested mountains for over a day before finally being starved and coerced out into surrender. \n\nThe marines set up a local garrison upon the capture of the island chain, and were faced with only minor civilian resistance before finally handing the island chain over to the French government. A local administration is presently being set up and the islands will soon be fully integrated into the colonial sphere."
fra.58.a: "A necessity in order to ensure peace."
###
fra.59.t: "Occupation of the Pyrenees"
fra.59.d: "French mountaineers have set up defensive positions along the Pyrenees and seized several key towns in the region. There was a surprisingly large loss of life as the entrenched Spanish positions proved to be extremely fortified, but the passes have finally come under our control."
fra.59.a: "A necessity in order to ensure peace."
###
fra.60.t: "French diplomatic tensions"
fra.60.d: "News from Paris has reached us earlier today detailing French plans to pursue a staunchly anti-British foreign and domestic policy. It would seem that the outcome of the London Naval Conference has finally tipped the scale and pushed the French from our side. While this certainly gives Germany the upper hand diplomatically, we ourselves may be able to benifit from this event, as the French have now diplomatically isolated themselves from the most powerful empire the globe has ever seen."
fra.60.a: "We will watch these events closely..."
###
fra.61.t: "Rise of the AF"
fra.61.d: "With the appointment of Charles Maurras as the head of the French government, the Action Française has risen to prominence and taken the forefront of French politics. Monarchists are entering government positions at a staggering rate, and there is talk of restoring the French monarchy under the house of Orleans. Whether or not these rumours will prove to be true is yet to be seen, but there is a large political shift taking place internally, and we may soon see yet another radical change in French politics."
fra.61.a: "Turmoil may be on the horizon"
###
fra.62.t: "The French demand Wallonia!"
fra.62.d: "Despite our best hopes, the authoritarian regime in France has begun to look outwards with an expansionist policy. We have recieved an official diplomatic telegram from Paris outlining a list of demands, notably including the transfer of the French-speaking region of Wallonia. \n\nWallonia is an integral part of the Belgian nation, and handing it over to the French would mean practically surrendering our sovereignty to the French. However, victory is unlikely unless we are able to secure the backing of another major European power, and the British appear to be our only choice in that matter. \n\nHow should we proceed?"
fra.62.a: "Alas, we are powerless."
fra.62.b: "The Belgian lion stands her ground!"
###
fra.63.t: "The Belgians beg for our support!"
fra.63.d: "We've recieved an urgent telegram from Brussels, it would appear the French have demanded that the Belgians give up several sovreign rights as well as the region of Wallonia. The Belgians, ever defiant and determined to remain independent, have requested that we back them both politically and militarily in the case of a French incursion into their territory. Accepting may prevent another major war in Europe from starting, but there is an equal chance of us starting a war with the French which may soon engulf the world in flames,  we must choose carefully."
fra.63.a: "The Belgians have our unconditional support!"
fra.63.b: "We must abandon our European allies for the time being."
###
fra.64.t: "The Belgians are stalling!"
fra.64.d: "In a long-winded and needlessly verbose response, the Belgians have sent us a response in which they appear to have neither agreed to nor denied our demands, and they are clearly stalling for time. We cannot simply invade the Belgians, as we do not yet have a just cause, and we may risk an international coalition of nations reminiscent of that which brought down Napoleon I in the earth 19th Century. The British are the Belgians most likely ally, and we have no choice but to wait and see what their response is to the situation."
fra.64.a: "Let's hope Albion refuses to meddle in our affairs."
###
fra.65.t: "Britain gives us their backing!"
fra.65.d: "Joyous news has arrived from London, the British government has given us their full political and military backing against the French demands. While many are worried that another major European war may loom on the horizon, the French are likely to simply back down when we have the backing of an international empire at our side."
fra.65.a: "We should prepare for war either way..."
###
fra.66.t: "Britain has backed the Belgians"
fra.66.d: "It seems that the Belgian effort to stall us has worked, as they have somehow managed to acquire the full backing of the British Empire. This development has decisively turned the tables from our favour, and much of the government believes that a war with Britain could end disasterously with the current political situation in Europe. Backing down would make us look weak and lead to internal instability, but pressing our claim may drag us into a war in which we have no ability to win."
fra.66.a: "We will face the British lion if we must"
fra.66.b: "They played us like a damn fiddle!"
###
fra.67.t: "France presses their claims to Wallonia"
fra.67.d: "It would appear that our new alliance with Britain was not enough to convince the wardogs in France to back down, and they have demanded the immediate transfer of Wallonia to French authority or face military action. The fate of two great empires has fallen into our lap, and it is our choice whether or not these behemoths will clash."
fra.67.a: "We have British backing, we can't lose!"
fra.67.b: "Wallonia isn't worth a global conflict."
###
fra.68.t: "Belgium stands defiant!"
fra.68.d: "It seems the British have given the Belgians enough confidence to deny our demands, and they have left us with no other choice than to press our claims with military force. While this outcome is regretable, there is little doubt that we will be able to best both the British and Belgians on the field."
fra.68.a: "The Armée Royale will not be defeated!"
###
fra.69.t: "Britain has abandoned us!"
fra.69.d: "Disasterous news, the British have refused to abandon their isolationist policy and have chosen instead to abandon us in our hour of need. We have little left to stall the French with, and they are pressing us further with their territorial and military demands."
fra.69.a: "Can't trust anyone these days, can you?"
###
fra.70.t: "Britain has abandoned the Belgians!"
fra.70.d: "It appears the British lion wishes to sleep a little while longer, as they have refused to support the Belgians in their effort to stall the inevitable and create a potentially global conflict. Nothing lays in our path now, and we are free to enforce our demands for Wallonia once and for all."
fra.70.a: "Let's finally resolve this matter"
###
fra.71.t: "The French Ultimatum"
fra.71.d: "We have been abandoned by our allies, and the French have seen fit to enforce their demands upon us. French soldiers wait just across the border for the signal to attack, and we are hopelessly powerless to defeat them diplomatically. Our only hope now is to either cede Wallonia and hope for peace, or use rivers and bunkers to delay the French invasion long enough for a miracle to occur. \n\nThis next decision could dictate the course of our nation for decades to come, think carefully."
fra.71.a: "We will defeat the French on the field!"
fra.71.b: "We will have our revenge one day..."
###
fra.72.t: "The Belgians continue to defy us!"
fra.72.d: "In a completely unexpected turn, the Belgians have decided that it is in their best interests to refuse our demands and prepare for combat. We fully expect to crush the Belgian army, and many believe we will be in Brussels by the end of the week."
fra.72.a: "To war, by jingo!"
###
fra.73.t: "Complete Economic Collapse"
fra.73.d: "The worst has finally come, the funds we allocated specifically to deal with the economic collapse have all been used up and we are officially bankrupt. Requests for additional funding have been blatently denied by the ministy of finance, who no longer trust us to spend the money wisely. \n\nOur economy has been completely trashed, and individual sectors of the government have begun to pool their resources to overcome the crisis as best as possible. While we believe this will pass, it will be a long while yet."
fra.73.a: "Oops?"
###
fra.74.t: "Provisional Government Militia Forms!"
fra.74.d: "Thanks to our efforts with setting up the GFPA, we have managed to wrangle up a small army which was waiting in Africa. We now have a force to defend our coasts from the Germans and, god willing, assist us in returning to the mainland one day in the future."
fra.74.a: "Joyous news!"
###
fra.75.t: "The Autonomy of Paris"
fra.75.d: "In the time leading up to the Franco-Prussian war and the short-lived Paris Commune, the population of Paris began to grow more and more discontent with the rule of Emperor Napoleon III and began to demand more autonomous rights which were already enjoyed by smaller towns across France. These wishes were unmet by the Emperor, and only three months after Paris surrendered to the Prussian army in 1871, the city declared an independent Commune headed by the radicalized national guard who were originally charged with defending the city. \n\nWhilst the Commune was defeated a mere ten days after its foundation at the hands of the French armed forces, its legacy remained strong in the hearts and minds of Parisian citizens. The Communard spirit still holds strong in some of the cities population, and many still call for increased independance and autonomy; Now that these wishes have after so long finally been granded, the citizens of Paris cheer for the government and champion further decentralization throughout the country, and whilst we aren't prepared to take such extreme measures to replecate the old Paris Commune, listening to the people may actually prove useful for once."
fra.75.a: "A Victory For The People!"
###
fra.76.t: "Bordeaux Protests Parisian autonomy!"
fra.76.d: "As expected, we have recieved localized backlash due to our granting of Parisian autonomy in the city of Bordeaux on the Western coast of France. The citizens are engaging in small-scale rioting and demanding the same privilages as Paris. We cannot give in to these demands, as it will almost certainly cause a domino effect which will lead to the complete decentralization and overall weakening of our state. All we can do now is hunker down and wait for the wave of unrest to pass."
fra.76.a: "Blast!"
###
fra.77.t: "Marseille Protests Parisian autonomy!"
fra.77.d: "As expected, we have recieved localized backlash due to our granting of Parisian autonomy in the city of Marseille on the Mediterranean coast of France. The citizens are engaging in small-scale rioting and demanding the same privilages as Paris. We cannot give in to these demands, as it will almost certainly cause a domino effect which will lead to the complete decentralization and overall weakening of our state.

He and his squadron were outnumbered nearly 3-1, and were forced into a quick retreat when the superior German aircraft began to overrun the French pilots. As Marcel's squadron evacuated West to the safety of the allied AA guns, he stayed behind in order to distract the Germans, fully expecting to be shot down within minutes. To his surprise, the German aircraft themselves started retreating East, possibly believing that the French withdrawl was a ruse.

Many tanks like Vieux fidèle were produced in the Soviet Union in the years leading up to their war with the new German Reich, and when war finally came these tanks were quickly sent to the frontline to act mainly as anti-infantry weapons due to their ineffectiveness against contemporary German armour. Due to their aformentioned ineffectiveness, these tanks were often abandoned by their crews once ammo ran dry or their position became tenuous, leading to many of them falling into German hands. \n\nOnce in German posession, these tanks were dissected and scrapped for parts or spare metal, but a select few were recommissioned under the Wehrmacht and sent back to the frontline. Of course, these tanks weren't sent back East due to the risk that German soldiers may become confused seeing Soviet tanks fighting on their side; instead these tanks were sent West to fight the French Army. \n\nDue to the poor preformance of these tanks, the German crews found themselves abandoning them at the slightest hint of danger, and the French anti-tank guns were able to make swiss cheese out of the outdated Soviet tanks. Despite their low number on the Western Front, a single tank was able to be commandeered by the French Army without being destroyed, this tank was affectionately named Vieux fidèle when it was discovered to have originally been of Soviet origin. The German markings were painted over and replaced with the French roundel, and the tank was prompty driven back to Paris where it was put on display for the citizenry to see. \n\nRarely does something like this occur, we should charish this moment of brevity as the days ahead of us loom darker and darker."

While not an official stance, many inside and outside of the party believe that should they come to power, the Third Republic would soon be replaced by the Fourth. \n\nFor now, the party remains small, and isolated to the region of Aquitaine, and there is practically no chance of them gaining any real political power or relevance. Of course, this could all easily change should the crisis grow far worse than it currently is, what happens after that is anyone's guess."
fra.133.a: "An interesting development"
###
fra.134.t: "SFIO members defect"
fra.134.d: "Following Paul Ramadier's inspiring break from the SFIO along with a large minority of its members the party has undergone massive internal reorganization and restructuring, with the party growing ever closer to the PCF and PFNC, alienating much of its popular support. The direct benefactors of this development have been the QP, whom many are flocking to as the legitimate reincarnation of the SFIO. Of course, the SFIO still controls the majority of the popular base, and is still the largest leftist party in France by a very wide margin, and have been undergoing major internal structural changes. It will take more than this to kill the SFIO, but the cracks are beginning to show."
fra.134.a: "The SFIO will grow strong once again"
fra.134.b: "This may be the beginning of something big"
###
fra.135.t: "The Quatrième Parti disbands"
fra.135.d: "Fate does not favour the ambitious afterall, it would seem. Yesterday, Paul Ramadier announced in front of a crowd in the Commune of Decazeville that he would be officially disbanding the Quatrième Parti and rejoining the SFIO. This news quickly follows the radical restructuring that the SFIO went under, and how successful it was in streamlining the party and gaiing a large amount of popularity from the right. \n\nWhile no official explaination has been given, it is deemed likely that the proverbial wind was knocked out of the QP's sails when the SFIO refused to stagnate and crumble under the loss of that many party members. Instead, the already few members of the QP lost faith and rejoined the SFIO in droves. Soon the party existed only on paper, and was promptly disbanded."
fra.135.a: "Another footnote of history lost..."
###
fra.136.t: "Paul Ramadier announces his candidacy"
fra.136.d: "The upstart and highly momentus Quatrième Parti has been rapidly gaining popularity, and it comes as little surprise to hear that the leader of the party, Paul Ramadier, has announced his candidacy in the 1936 election. While the party remains relatively small, they are rapidly catching up to the SFIO and some experts believe they may be able to overtake them before the beginning of the election. \n\nThe political scandal refuses to quiet down, more and more government officials are found to be involved and the shockwaves seem to have implications that will stretch for years. If the QP is able to deal a knockout blow to the SFIO, they may surpass the party and propel themselves into one of the top contenders in the upcoming election."
fra.136.a: "Change seems to be on the horizon..."
###
fra.137.t: "Russians in the Entente"
fra.137.d: "During the First Great War, the Russian Empire provided invaluable assistance in bringing down the Central Powers and restoring peace to Europe, even though they eventually lost to the revolutionaries, they were kept afloat in the Far East under the protection of an international coalition. Now, the Russians are back in control of their homeland and are once again bashing in the German door alongside us. However, they are not formally part of any alliance, and this is hindering our progress somewhat. \n\nInviting the Russians to our faction will undoubtedly strengthen both of us a great deal, and allow for greater military and economic cooperation between our two spheres. Of course, this does also mean that we will be obligated to give the Russians a piece of the pie when the war is won, and do we want a Russia in complete control of Eastern Europe, erecting a curtain of iron around their puppet states?"
fra.137.a: "The Russians are an invaluable asset, we must implore them!"
fra.137.b: "We will not follow the mistakes of Napoleon!"
###
fra.138.t: "The French offer us an alliance"
fra.138.d: "The French state has apporached us with an offer. Seeing as we are both currently waging war against Germany, they propose that we formalize our alliance and renew the Friendship we held during the years of 1914 to 1919. This could put is in a vert advantageous position diplomatically, with a nearly guarenteed hegemony over Eastern Europe and perhaps even Berlin itself..."
fra.138.a: "Friends until the end!"
fra.138.b: "Never trust a Frenchman with an arm behind his back..."
###
fra.139.t: "Russia accepts!"
fra.139.d: "The Russians have accepted our offer, and are now an official member of the Continental Entente."
fra.139.a: "Wonderful!"
###
fra.140.t: "Russia declines"
fra.140.d: "The Russians have seen fit to decline our most generous offer, they would rather fight the Germans on their own."
fra.140.a: "Bastards! Hey, are we allowed to supply the German troops on the Eastern Front out of spite?"
###
fra.5000.t: "France offers arms contracts!"
fra.5000.d: "The French have approached our government with an offer, they are willing to hand over several factories for a period of 90 days in exchange for some of our newest military technology or a large sum of guns. Accepting this offer would be of great benifit to our industry, but should the French ever come to oppose us, we would be lowering our chances of victory against them."

fra.5003.a: "Wonderful news"
###
fra.5004.t: "Unsuccessful Circumnavigation!"
fra.5004.d: "Bad news, it would appear that our pilot that we sent to circumnagivate the globe in a custom D.520 has not arrived at his scheduled stop at Saigon and is now several days behind schedule. It would seem that the aircraft must have suffered a mechanical failure somewhere over the pacific ocean and crashed somewhere. The odds of finding the wreckage are basically zero, and an honorary funeral has been scheduled for the pilot."
fra.5004.a: "How tragic!"
###
fra.5005.t: "A foreigner from the air"
fra.5005.d: "Something strange appears to have happened at one of our Jiangxi airports. In the waking hours of yesterday morning, an unidentified plane of unknown make and model appeared over the horizon before proceeding to circle the airfield several times and land. When the plane taxied off of the runway, the pilot was greeted by several garrisoned regiments all pointing their rifles at him. The man spoke a language unlike those at the airbase, and was soon identified to be of French origin. \n\nThe man explained that he was sent on a mission to circumnagivate the globe with his aircraft in as little time as possible, but he made a wrong course correction and landed here rather than Saigon where he intended to  be. Inspection of his aircraft showed that it was no longer airworthy and the engine was severely damaged from stress, but the airframe and the pilot are otherwise unharmed.\n\nThe pilot was taken to a nearby city and treated to the local food before being asked if he would like to be sent to Saigon where he could rejoin his comrades. Shockingly, the pilot declined the offer, and it seems he has taken a keen interest in our culture and country, and late in the day he asked if he could stay where he was, and join our Chinese Air Force. It seems that the pilot made his choice, and he was formally accepted into our air force as a pilot."
fra.5005.a: "Give him back his aircraft too."
fra.5005.b: "Dismantle his plane, we must learn its secrets."

We will approach the Italians in order to decide the fate of Switzerland, and hopefully find a satisfying solution. \n\nThe Swiss government of course will not be invited to these talks, but why would they be?"

FRA_black_monday: "Response to Black Wednesday"
FRA_black_monday_desc: "The banks have closed and many companies are filing for bankruptcy. Many citizens are demanding their money in cash, and our government is being denounced in the streets. Several plans have been put forward to resolve this crisis, but we have a very limited budget to work with due to the recent economic scandal which rocked the French economic and political scene. If we do not enact these decisions quickly and get our economy back on its feet, we may be faced with something far worse than falling stock prices.\n\nTo effectively remove Black Wednesday effects you need to make unemployment to less than §Y2%§! and inflation at less than §Y15%§!.\n\nCurrently the values are:\n\nFree Budget: §G[?Root.frenchBudgetAmount] million§! Francs.\nInflation: §Y[?fra_var_inflation]%§!.\nUnemployment: §R[?fra_var_unemployment]%§!."

Siphoning funds from the colonial treasury will grant us a quick injection of funds, but selecting this option too many times may destabalize our colonies to the point of collapse..."
###
FRA_occupy_canary: "Occupy the Canaries"
FRA_occupy_canary_desc: "The Canary Islands are a highly strategic set of islands off the coast of Morocco, presently under the control of the Spanish falangists. We cannot allow a dictatorial and authoritarian regime such as them to have control of such an important area, as such we should launch an invasion of the islands to occupy them."
###
FRA_occupy_border: "Secure our Southern border"
FRA_occupy_border_desc: "The Spanish Civil War shows no sign of slowing down, and the socialists have endured the past year with strength in Barcelona. The Pyrenees mountains contain several passes which presently lie in Spanish territory, meaning that they could provide easy invasion points in case the socialists prove victorious in the war. We should conduct an operation to secure these passes and prevent a Spanish invasion from ever taking place."
###
FRA_eng_menace: "The British Menace"
FRA_eng_menace_desc: "The aggressive British have shown their true face, and have pursued a staunchly anti-French foreign policy both in Europe and abroad. As English diplomats scramble to arrange alliances and treaties which aim to diminish our power, the Continential Entente watches dutifully along the coast for the royal ensign on the horizon.\n\n Of course, the best defense is a good offense, and the British will have a difficult time planning attacks against an enemy which is dynamically changing and evolving. As a result, we need to pursue our own anti-British policy and ensure that we don't see a repeat of the Hundred Years War."
###
FRA_penetrate_channel: "Penetrate the Channel"
FRA_penetrate_channel_desc: "The English channel has been under British hegemony for centuries past, and any naval excercises we attempt in the channel are often met with close supervision from the British. We should send our navy into the channel and send them straight towards the cliffs of Dover, and see what the British response is."
###
FRA_demand_wallonia: "Demand Wallonia"
FRA_demand_wallonia_desc: "The overwhelming majority of the population living in the Belgian region of Wallonia speaks French, and a degree of them consider themselves ethnically French. A small political ideology exists within both Belgium and France known as Rattachism, which seeks to unite Wallonia with France and integrate it as a département. The rise of our militarist, nationalist, and expansionist government has finally allowed us to justify expressing our demands upon the Belgian government. \n\n§YThe Belgian government is unlikely to accept our demand, and if they have the backing of another major European power our chances of resolving this issue peacefully are practically zero. We should ensure our military is at full capability before sending our demands.§!"

FRA_parisian_autonomy: "Grant Parisian Autonomy"
FRA_parisian_autonomy_desc: "The citizens and workers of Paris have long cried out for increased autonomy and self-governance like that enjoyed by our smaller metropolitan cities. They wish for their own elected council and less direct administration from the French government. Granting these rights will certainly gain us some popular support, but other cities may be displeased by our clear favour towards the capital region."
###
FRA_curb_unions: "Curb Unionization"
FRA_curb_unions_desc: "Unionization rates in France skyrocketed during the 1920s and 30s, and soon became a hotbed for communist activity and organization. Whilst we cannot outright ban unionization, as that would undoubtedly lead to mass striking across the entire nation and bring our industry to a complete standstill, we can take certain measures to decrease rising unionization rates and make union members inelligable for token government benifits. \n\nThis action will certainly upset the socialist movements within France and may potentially alienate us from the industrial workers, but may be a necesary step in avoiding a complete socialist takeover of our nation."
###
FRA_expand_marseille: "Expand the Marseille Port"
FRA_expand_marseille_desc: "The city and port of Marseille are of vital importance when it comes to controlling the Mediterranian Sea, and without it we would be strategically isolated from our colonies in North Africa. Expanding the port will allow us to exert more influence over the Mediterranian as well as Algeria and our protectorates in Morocco and Tunisia."
###
FRA_secure_bosphorus: "Secure the Bosphorus"
FRA_secure_bosphorus_desc: "Recent political developments in Anatolia have dearly threatened our access to the Black Sea and international trade through the Bosphorus strait, and the radical Turkish government has made it clear that they intend to nationalize the strait and prevent foriegn ships from entering what they claim to be sovreign waters. Diplomatic efforts have failed and the time has come to force the Turks to open the Bosphorus to us."
###
FRA_secure_siam: "Secure Siam"
FRA_secure_siam_desc: "The Siamese nation exists primarily as a buffer state between French Indochina and the British posessions in Malaya and India, but international interest in subdueing the nation has left us with little other choice than to invade the primitive kingdom ourselves to secure our interests in the region. The jungle terrain and extensive rivers will allow us to gain a defensive position against the British if they decide to press an attack into the region, which should give us enough time to send reinforcements and prepare for a counterattack."

But for this zenith to occur, we require the entire state to be in full support of our policies and commands. Several regions in France have denounced the kings return, and we are presently in a period of great civil strife. \n\nIn order to restore order to the nation we will need to either reach a compromise with or militarily intervene in each of the rebellious regions. We must be wary however, as militarily dealing with the resistance may lower our legitimacy and turn what support we have against us! \nWe should aim to keep our legitimacy above §G20%§!.\n\nOur current available §YRoyal Authority:§! §G[?Root.FrenchMonarchPower]§! \n\nOur current §Yperceived legitimacy:§! §G[?Root.FrenchLegitimacy]%§!"
