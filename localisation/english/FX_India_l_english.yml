#####Events#####

indrev.1.t: "The Revolution Has Begun!"
indrev.1.d: "All across the Raj, people are rising up. The British are scrambling to respond, and in some cases are in full-fledged retreat. Their capital city of New Dehli is surrounded by armed bands, and freedom for India appears like it may finally be a real possibility. We have a long fight ahead of us, and many brave patriots will die before it's over. But so long as we continue to keep the British on the backfoot, and always on the retreat, we may be able to win the day. For far too long, the British Empire has taken advantage of India and its resources. It has destroyed the very civilization we built up over millennia, and today is the beginning of the end of their occupation. Today will forever mark the beginning of our independence! The beginning of our freedom!"
indrev.1.a: "For a Free India!"
indrev.2.t: "Victory is Ours!"
indrev.2.d: "The last British garrisons have waved the white flag. The administration is burning documents by the tonne and fleeing by boat to Ceylon. There they hope to set up some kind of shadow government, perhaps to someday attempt to reconquer us. But the outcome today is clear. British Parliament is already entering talks to sue for peace, and soon, our fight will be won. After 200 years of brutal occupation by a foreign oppressor, we shall finally have our freedom!"
indrev.2.a: "India is Finally Free!"
indrev.3.t: "Defeat Approaches"
indrev.3.d: "The British have come to the subcontinent en masse. Forces from across the Empire now batter and bloody us at every turn, and our strongholds become fewer and fewer in number. Our leadership is scattered, our fighters are unorganized, and any foreign support we may have once had has abandoned us. Yet we continue to fight. Not because we will win, but because this is the eternal struggle. 200 years of brutal occupation by a foreign oppressor has led to this, and even if we lose today, we will fight so that our sons may fight again tomorrow. Down with the British. Long live India."
indrev.3.a: "We shall fight to the end!"
indrev.11.t: "Indian Rebels Ask for Assistance"
indrev.11.d: "As we speak, our rivals in the British Empire are struggling to put down an intense revolt in their Indian colony. While it is technically breaking several treaties we have signed with Britain, our diplomats in Pondichery have been approached by leaders of several of the cooperating rebel groups. They are asking us for material assistance if we can spare it. If we give it to them, we could help strike a major blow against the British Empire. Then again, it is Britain we are speaking of. No matter how many men they have, these rebels will always be outgunned..."
indrev.11.a: "The enemy of my enemy is my friend..."
indrev.11.b: "Maybe next time."
indrev.12.t: "Indian Rebels Ask for Assistance"
indrev.12.d: "As we speak, the imperialists in the British Empire are struggling to put down an intense revolt in their Indian colony. Among them are Indian communists who are fighting for the opportunity to create a communist state in south Asia. Meeting some of our operatives in the mountains of Central Asia, leaders of this rebel groups are asking us for material and military assistance if we can spare it. If we give it to them, we could help strike a major blow against the British Empire and create a loyal fellow communist state in India. Then again, we are struggling to produce enough supplies for ourselves..."
indrev.12.a: "Anything for our fellow comrades."
indrev.12.b: "We don't have anything to spare."
indrev.13.t: "Indian Rebels Ask for Assistance"
indrev.13.d: "As we speak, the imperialists in the British Empire are struggling to put down an intense revolt in their Indian colony. Among them are Indian nationalists who are fighting for the opportunity to create a nationalist state in south Asia. While it took several feats for our operatives to meet with them, leaders of this rebel groups are asking us for material and military assistance if we can spare it. If we give it to them, we could help strike a major blow against the British Empire and create a loyal fellow nationalist state in India. Then again, Britain could be a potential ally against France in the future..."
indrev.13.a: "Let's strike a blow to the Empire."
indrev.13.b: "Best not to provoke Britain at this time."

india.1.t: "The Power Vacuum"
india.1.d: "With the British driven from our fair country, and a modicum of stability established across our new united nation, a Leadership Election has been called by the Provisional Government in Delhi, with Militia Leaders, the old Princes of the Raj, and the Communist Councils of the east given the right to vote.\n\nHowever, the election resulted in a deadlock. Corruption between the Princes and Militia representatives, along with the sizeable representation of the Communists, prevented anyone from gaining a true majority.\n\nThe power vacuum caused by the sudden collapse of the Raj must be filled soon, or our administration may collapse entirely!"
india.1.a: "Hold an election immediately!"
india.1.b: "We have no need for elections..."
india.2.t: "Elections for Indian Parliament"
india.2.d: "What is a new nation without an election? The British permitted us to hold elections, but the positions we were able to vote for had little power to stop the Empire from doing whatever it wanted. Now, our nation shall be ruled by a national Parliament and Prime Minister. While we are all united in democracy, however, the country is still divided on which path it should take going forward. Three major ideologies have risen across a swath of regional parties: Communists, Liberals, and Nationalists. The Communists, mostly based out of eastern India, seek to create a Soviet-style system of welfare . Since their support is geographically limited, their chances of success are low. The liberals, meanwhile, have taken form in the Indian National Congress, and already have a major power base throughout the country. Their chances of success are highest of the three. Finally, there are the nationalists. Inspired by systems like German Valkism, candidates of this ideology seek to create an Indian state strong enough to fend off its enemies and find a spot among the world's top empires. Their odds of success are also remote. But as Indians head to the polls, they all have one question on thier lips: who will lead India in to the future?"
india.2.a: "The Communists win a majority."
india.2.b: "The Indian National Congress prevails."
india.2.c: "The nationalists sweep Parliament."


india.40.t: "Disturbance in Parliament"
india.40.d: "Today, several members of Parliament engaged in nothing less than an all-out brawl on the debate floor. It appears that several members of the Hindu Mahasabha party, which follows a strand of Hindu-oriented Valkism, instigated a fight with several members of the Indian National Congress. While injuries were limited to little more than a broken wrist and a few bruises, we will doubtless become the laughingstock of the world when this news reaches news outlets in Europe and America. This comes amidst our attempts to foster ties essential to building a strong and lasting state, and could jeopardize those attempts. While Parliament's security forces were able to easily break up the brawl and temproarily incarcerate the offenders, some in our government are calling for us to take a sterner approach - namely to arrest the Hindu Mahasabha insigators and charge them in criminal court. Doing so could send a strong message to the world that we will not tolerate this kind of base behavior in our government, but it could also result in blowback from supporters of the party. Still, is some slight unrest worth jeopardizing our foreign ties?"
india.40.a: "They'll figure it out."
india.40.b: "Arrest the offenders."
india.41.t: "Valkist Militias Call for Release of Leaders"
india.41.d: "A number of Valkist militias, largely made up of former rebels from the countryside, have congregated outside of the Parliament building in New Delhi. They are demanding the immediate release of the members of the Hindu Mahasabha party who were arrested after engaging in an all-out brawl on the floor of Parliament. While our police forces are present and prepared to deal with any escalation of tensions, several members of our government have suggested it might be best to just release the members of Parliament on strict parole. Others are staunchly against this proposal, claiming that doing so will only encourage further antics from the Valkist party in the future. Either way, the armed militias outside are a worrying sight..."
india.41.a: "Release the offenders."
india.41.b: "They're in jail for a reason."
india.42.t: "Valkist Militias Gather in New Delhi"
india.42.d: "More and more armed Valkist militias have begun to gather in New Dehli. Entire boulevards have now been shut down, and members of Parliament have been forced to evacuate the Parliament building. Some small-scale violence has broken out throughout the city between Valkist militiamen and supporters of the Indian National Congress, but nothing too serious - yet. Their protests grow in size and scale every day, but some of our advisers are telling us to let them continue to protest until their movement fizzles out. A small minority, however, are pushing for sending in the Indian army and removing the militias by force. That path will undoubtedly lead to violence, and potentially death. But it would surely remove the militias from the city, if all goes according to plan. What shall we do?"
india.42.a: "Let them protest."
india.42.b: "Send in the army."
india.43.t: "Coup!"
india.43.d: "When the Indian army swept into the streets to remove the Valkist militias that had gathered in New Dehli, all hell broke loose. Half of the fighting men appeared to be sympathetic with the Valkists, and before long the militias had taken up positions throughout the city and stormed the Parliament building, taking hostage what few staffers were unfortunate enough to still be there. After a fierce bout of prolonged fighting, Valkist militias also stormed the Secretariat Building and took the nation's cabinet captive. A few members, including the Prime Minister, escaped and fled the city, but their chances of escape from the country are slim. When the fighting ultimately died down, it was the Valkist militias that were in control of the entirety of New Dehli. Orders were trasmitted across all of India, ordering the army to stand down and swear fealty to the new government. Some divisions refused, and others disbanded entirely. But the vast majority of them swore their loyalty, and cemented the new government of India. The Valkist Hindu Mahasabha party now rules the nation, and will dictate its path going forward."
india.43.a: "The government is deposed."

india.45.t: "The Akhand Bharat"
india.45.d: "The concept of the Akhand Bharat, or an Undivided India, has long been on the periphery of Indian politics. British officials and legislators alike dismissed it as impossible, simply a make-believe theory touted by irredentists who wish to start wars. But they were wrong. The Akhand Bharat is something that we can make very real today. The lands of Undivided India are divided now between numerous countries. But if we strike them now, and we strike them hard, we can take the land that is so rightfully ours. All of the former Raj, Afghanistan, Nepal, Bhutan, Tibet, Burma, and Ceylon, can be ours. And once we have fulfilled the Akhand Bharat - once we have shown the world our true might - we can take our place alongside the other empires of the world...and exact our revenge."
india.45.a: "The time has come for an Undivided India."

india.20.d: "While our forces have been tied down in establishing rule of law in once lawless regions, the Indian Princes have been waiting for their opportunity. In the chaos that has followed the removal of the British from the Continent; the Princes have established their own militia forces in several regions and have moved towards creating their own administration in these regions.\n\nThey insist that this administration is only temporary and that it will be dissolved once the Delhi Administration meets for the first time. Doubts linger however over their sincerity, only time will tell."
india.30.d: "This morning the Provisional Government officially met for the first time in Delhi. Militia leaders, Communists, Princes and our own representatives have conducted the first of several preliminary meetings in the recently constructed Secretariat Building which we have chosen to act as our temporary house of government, the meetings were tense and many ideological conflicts underpinned the proposals made by the different representatives. The biggest issue raised at the meeting was that of regional autonomy, particularly the illegal administrations created by the Princes recently.\n\nThe issue may not have been settled this time, but we are confident we can overcome our differences and come to a final settlement eventually."
india.49.d: "Early this afternoon a major situation occurred on the streets of our capital. Confronted by our police force, a squad of militia members and their leader refused orders to hand over their weapons after the police were informed that they were intimidating civilians nearby. Arguing that their weapons were needed for self-defence, the situation continued for several hours until our own leadership intervened and prevented the situation from escalating further."
india.50.d: "Today's meeting was due to continue into well into the evening, but the Communist representatives staged a walk-out, followed shortly after by delegations from the numerous Princes due to disagreements over autonomy in several provinces. Many within our own government have expressed concerns that the Communists have been stalling for time to establish total control over their own territory."
india.60.d: "As expected, the Communist delegations have been stalling for time; in order for their own plans to move continue uninterrupted. It was unknown what exactly these plans were until this morning. They were worse than we had predicted, the Communists in Calcutta have set up their own ''People's Assembly'' to govern the region, and have announced a boycott of future meetings between our Provisional Government and their own rival Government.\n\nTaking advantage of the situation, the Princes have also declared their withdrawal from further Parliamentary meetings, arguing that if our Government cannot exert control over the East of the country, then its legitimacy is called into question."
india.70.d: "With our victory over the British in our struggle for freedom, many believed that a highpoint in our history had been reached by vanquishing an Empire many times more powerful than our own nation. Those voices are silent on this day, and those words only sound hollow after developments in recent months.\n\nFollowing the calling of the first Leadership Election many weeks ago, things have only gone downhill. The failure of the representatives to compromise on important issues, the refusal of militia leaders to give up their arms and hand over administration to our Government, and the creation of a separate People's Assembly in Calcutta have only undermined our Government's position and legitimacy in governing India. To add more fuel to the fire, the Princes used the disarray to establish their own rule in several areas, utilising their own private armies and militia to force local administration to answer to their rule, rumours also persist that some of these Princes are still inclined to do business with the British, even after everything our people have been through.\n\nThe past several days have only seen this situation worsen drastically with militia leaders taking control over their own regions and refusing to allow our troops to pass. Seizing on the opportunity, the veritable thorn in our side, the Communist Government in Calcutta, has also begun setting up checkpoints in many major areas inside their territory. It would seem that despite our claim to controlling all of India, that our own hold was looser than anticipated."
natind.1.d: "The situation we are faced with is a dangerous one, if we may one wrong move we may cease to exist all together therefore we must remain strong and united. If we are to unite the Indian people under one flag then we must ensure strong leadership. As a result, official elections for the National Government have been promised. A date has not been decided for the elections though it is likely they will be called once India has been sufficiently reclaimed. Until then, the Provisional Government will rule alone."
natind.2.d: "The establishment of a real government has allowed us to begin extensive efforts towards reorganising our armies into a cohesive army. With the many princely armies and communist militias now working on their own, we have have organised a central command structure that should hopefully transform the mob of soldiers that composed the rebellion into a genuine fighting force."
natind.3.d: "It is all well and good for the Provisional Government to claim control, but it means nothing if the people do not obey our authority. Therefore we must enforce our authority, we cannot afford to fall further then we already have."
natind.4.d: "In the wake of British rule, we put ourselves forward as the authority for all of India. A huge nation, filled with many different cultures and religions, it would be difficult for anyone to keep it united and strong but we were willing to try. However, our offer was crushed by the scheming of the Princes and the Militias, before being torn apart once and for all by the vile Communists in the East.\n\n This cannot last, we are the rightful rulers of India and no traitorous Prince or Communist heathen will take that away from us!"
natind.5.d: "India is an incredibly diverse nation, filled with many different cultures and religions and we are now tasked with deciding on the National Language. There are only really two choices, we could either go with the Hindi language as a reminder of our cultural heritage and ancient roots prior to the British invasion. While this would certainly gain us sizeable support at the moment, as our lands expand though it may cause tension in the largely Muslim regions of the west and east.\nAlternatively we could adopt English as our national language. It may be troublesome having to teach our population English, but it would keep things organised for when India as a whole is finally under our control."
