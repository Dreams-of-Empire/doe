AST_FUHRERREDUX_DESC: "The Commonwealth of Australia was established on January 1, 1901, uniting six self-governing colonies. It later became a Dominion within the British Empire. The Great War tested Australia's unity, raising doubts about the federal forces. The failure to complete the transcontinental railway heightened tensions between the East and West, leading to calls for secession. By 1936, regionalism and secessionist demands had eroded the country's unity. Established parties faced challenges from state parties and radical groups. While the current Labor government appeared stable, its unity could be superficial in times of adversity."

### Events
australia.0.t: "The Great Southern Land"
australia.0.d: "The Commonwealth of Australia was established on January 1. 1901, with the six self-governing colonies of Queensland, New South Wales, Victoria, Tasmania, South Australia, and Western Australia united into one Commonwealth. Not long after, the new nation would recieve the status of Dominion within the British Empire.\n\nWith the onset of the Great War, the unity of Australia would be seriously tested. The war was seen as a test for the federal forces to prove that they would be better than state-based militaries. With the death of many Australian sons, doubts regarding the federal forces began to brew. Another blow to the unity of Australia would be the failure to complete the transcontinental railway, increasing the tensions between the East and the West. When the economy of Western Australia collapsed during the 1920s, calls for secession would grow in the western state.\n\nWith the start of 1936, the unity once present in Australia seems to be replaced by regionalism and the western call for secession. While the traditional political players; Labor, Country and the Nationalists, have remained strong players in Australian politics, these parties are more and more plauged by regionalism from state parties, along with the growth of radical groups like the Communists and the AFM.\n\nThe current Labor-run government have continued to be stable, but this stability and unity might just prove to be a facade in the face of true adversity and crisis."

australia.1.t: "The King is Dead.."
australia.1.d: "News from England has hit the shores of Australia. The King of Australia, George V, has passed away from this world. All over the world, including here in Australia, the death of the King has been met with mourning.\n\nWhile the news are saddening for some. For others, they see the news of the King's death differently. Along with Australian people mourning the loss, there are many that has taken the news as an oppotunity to protest the monarchy. Especially in Western Australia has there been brewing some discontent from people losing faith in the monarchy and in the British Empire. These sentiments seems also to not only come from radicals on the left and the right, but also from those one could call "ordinary people".\n\nWhile the Australian government and many of the country's people answer the news with a "Long Live the King", some will instead answer it with a "Long Live the Republic"."
australia.1.a: "Troubling.."

australia.2.t: "The May Day Insident"
australia.2.d: "While the Labor Party are usually considered the leading party under the May Day celebrations, there have been some opposition growing to this recently. In both the demonstrations and in the unions, more and more space have been given to pro-Communist protestors.\n\nThis led to an embarassing insident in Western Australia, where a local branch of the ACTU, the Australian Council of Trade Unions, chose to not invite a local Labor leader, citing the party's slothful behavior in passing pro-Labor policies. As a result, this have led to an confrontration between supporters of Labor and aledged Communist-leaning ACTU members on May Day itself this year. Resulting in a pro-Labor Party banner being stolen and some violent behavior following it, the whole case has ended in a general embarassment for local Labor and ACTU members alike."

australia.3.t: "The 1936 Western Australia State Election"
australia.3.d: "These days, state elections have been held in the most-western state of Australia, Western Australia. The last election in the state saw a razor thin electoral victory for Labor and Philip Collier over the Nationalist-Country coalition led by James Mitchell.\n\nNow, three years later, the election in the state has been more troublesome than usual. While the victory for the Nationalist-Country coalition under Country's Charles Latham are expected, the more unexpected part is a strong showing of the Auralia Out Movement this election. Led by Australian nationalist and anti-monarchist Xavier Herbert, the movement has managed to secure two seats in the Western Australian Legislative Assembly through an unholy alliance between anti-monarchists of both the far-right as well as the far-left.\n\nWhat these news might mean for Western Australia and the country as a whole, can be worrying. It is to see if sensible politics are able to withstand these radical movements."
australia.3.a: "Rarely Any Good News From Perth.."

australia.4.t: "The Military Training Debate"
australia.4.d: "With the rise of Valkism in Europe, calls to make new reforms regarding military training in Australia has been called. Even with the situation ahead, the issue over a stronger and increased military training plan has been met with opposition among Labor politicians, even in the Federal Government itself.\n\nWhile both the Nationalist opposition as well as many Laborites and Country politicians urges the government to strengthen the military training of Australian soldiers, there are perhaps even more Laborites opposed to such a plan, along with many pacifists opposed to the military all together. In the end, this issue has not reached a conclusion, with the Federal Government choosing to do nothing for now."
australia.4.a: "Status Quo is Sometimes the Best"

australia.5.t: "London Stock Market Crash Hits Australia"
australia.5.d: "Disaster! The London Stock Market Crash has now spread all over the British Empire, inflicting a wound upon Australia. As in Britain, the Australian market has been draged into the dirt, leaving unemployment and economic damage in it's wake.\n\nEven then, something do tell us that the crash itself is just the start of a troublesome time in Australian history. Already lies the fairly sucessful premiership of James Scullin in ruins, with the opposition using the crisis as a way to drag the Federal Government down. In addition are disputes beginning to form between factions seeking different answers in solving the economic crisis. Even then, we would have to wait for the crisis to stabalize before doing anything to fix it."
australia.5.a: "God! Have You Abandoned Us?!"

australia.6.t: "Left Laborites Push For Socialization"
australia.6.d: "The Australian Labor Party is not at all completely unified on all things. Inside the party, a diverse cast of socialists to centrists can be found. This time, the Labor MP John Curtin has once more, along with his left-wing allies in the House, pushed for socialization of Australian infrastructure and critical industries. With the rising tentions in the world, Curtin sees these measures as an important step to secure the country's readyness, while also seing an end to the influence of capitalism on Australian infrastructure and critical industries. The hope Curtin have, is to see these changes for next year's budget.\n\nWhile the opposition from the Nationalists are suspected, Curtin was a bit taken back by the opposition from some of his own party comrades. Even if their opposition was more neuanced, they do still call him a socialist that seeks to uproot the good private initiatives of the country. After some time, Prime Minister James Scullin managed to end the debate inside Labor. Afraid that such disagreements can challenge the unity of the party, he urges Curtin and other Labor MPs to debate the party's stance on the backroom."
australia.6.a: "Why This Disunity, Men?"

australia.7.t: "Anti-Government Protests Begins"
australia.7.d: "With climbing unemployment and a broken market, people around the whole country are beginning to blame the government for this situation. Tricked in to belive in alternative solutions to Australia's problems, working class unemployed people have started to gather in the streets to protest the government.\n\nWith the Scullin cabinet still wondering how to respond to this crisis, a growing number of protests are poping up. One state ecpesially affected by both the economic crisis and increased riots, are Western Australia. With the crisis, the state's Auralia Movement have growned especially popular and the consept has been adopted by some western socialists and anti-monarchists."
australia.7.a: "Please Be Peaceful"

australia.8.t: "Labor Divided on Crisis Response"
australia.8.d: "With the economic crisis ravaging through Australia, calls for the Federal government to do something about it has emerged. With the Federal government inable to do anything, State governments have started to deal with the crisis in it's own way. Even so it is clear that we need a unified plan for recovery in Australia.\n\nEven if Labor is a socialist party, Prime Minister James Scullin has been hesitant to enforce a radical economic recovery plan on the country. With many voicing the opinion that a conservative plan would be better to keep spending and debt low, Scullin are showing interest in this solution. On the other side, both Labor MP John Curtin and the Premier of North South Wales, Jack Lang, seek a more interventionist approach.\n\nWith the crisis going on, it will be neseccary to choose a plan. Both for the well-being of the country as a whole and for the well-being of the Labor Party and Scullin's government."
australia.8.a: "Easier Said Than Done"

australia.9.t: "The Lyons Proposal"
australia.9.d: "Joseph Lyons, a economically conservative member of the Labor Party's caucus in the House, has announced a plan for economic recovery that has angered many radicals and left-wingers inside the Labor caucus. Lyons proposals to balancing the budget and cutting social spendings are so grand that even Prime Minister Scullin is hesitant.\n\nOn the other side, Mr. Lyons have gotten the support of many inside buisness, including influential members of the Melbourne Establishment. This support has alienated Lyons further from the labour union base of Labor, and if we are going to support his conservative plan, we might risk the party dividing between the right and the left. If we are to commit to Lyons' plan, we will see support from the Nationalist opposition.\n\nWith all this considered, our government have gotten both advice to reject and consider the plan announced by Joseph Lyons. Prime Minister James Scullin need to decide what will be done."
australia.9.a: "Lyons Got a Plan! Let's Try it Out"
australia.9.b: "No! This Plan Would Destroy Labor"

australia.10.t: "Anti-Austerity Labor Cross the Floor"
australia.10.d: "With the news of our adoption of Joseph Lyons' conservative recovery plan going through Australia, massive opposition was met from members of the party and different labour unions up to members of parliament sitting in the House. Today, led by John Curtin crossed left-leaning Labor MPs the floor, establishing a left-wing opposition to the current government.\n\nAlready, this Socialist Labor has gained the support of many labour unions and state parties previously tied to Labor. One surprising development was that the Jack Lang-led New South Wales branch of Labor did not join this new party. Instead, Lang seems to be as critical towards this Socialist Labor as he is towards the Lyons Plan."
australia.10.a: "The Left-Wing is Rising"

australia.11.t: "New South Wales Labor Bids Their Farewell"
australia.11.d: "In the wake of the left-wing split in the Labor Party, with the socialists establishing a left-wing opposition to the Labor government, new developments seems to happen in New South Wales.\n\nAs a strong critic against both socialism and the conservative economic plan that the Scullin government has adopted, Jack Lang has declared himself and the NSW branch of Labor independent from the Federal Labor Party. He is joined by most New South Wales Laborites, further dividing our caucus in the House. With these developments, Labor is left with a caucus just two members bigger than the Nationalist Party. This in a House that saw our caucus double the size of the Nationalist caucus just a few weeks ago."
australia.11.a: "How the Mighty has Fallen"

australia.12.t: "Unexpected Support"
australia.12.d: "With Labor seen the worst split in its history, there is not much left before the opposition Nationalist Party need to go before they can secure a victory over us. With them as our natural enemies in the House, it is surprising that they have now choosen to support the Scullin government. Opposition leader John Latham has declared that the Nationalist Party will support the current Labor government to asure stability through this economic crisis. In addition, Latham seeks to hinder any further growth in power to both Socialist Labor and Lang Labor.\n\nPrime Minister James Scullin has thanked Latham for his support, but has also reaffirmed that this does not mean that Labor will support Nationalist policies."

australia.13.d: "With our rejection of the conservative austerity plan of Joseph Lyons, many anti-austerity Laborites has seen it as a sign for their proposed solutions to be presented. Labor MPs from New South Wales has brought forth a proposal from the New South Wales Premier Jack Lang. In this plan of his, the Federal government enacts wide interventionist reforms based on the theories of British economist John Maynard Keynes.\n\nThe plan would be controversial amoung economically conservative members of Labor, as well as opposed by the Nationalist opposition. In return, many labour unions and left-wingers have voiced their support in the Lang Plan. This despite the anti-socialist views of Premier Lang. It will be up to Prime Minister James Scullin to agree to the plan or not."

australia.14.t: "Joseph Lyons Cross the Floor"
australia.14.d: "With the rejection of his plan by the Federal government, Joseph Lyons has left Labor. Together with other economically conservative Laborites, he has now found new friends amoung the Nationalist Party. From this base, the Nationalists has been absorbed by a new political force in Australia: The United Australia Party.\n\nWith the leadership of Joseph Lyons, this new opposition party has gained huge momentum. For the first time since 1934, Labor has gained a formidable challenge to their power. The new party has commited themselves to the conservative recovery plan of Lyons, cutting spendings and balancing the budget. In addition, the party seeks to unite Australian society as a whole against the Socialist and Valkist threats present in the world."
australia.14.a: "A Worthy Opponent Indeed"

australia.15.t: "Lang's Response"
australia.15.d: "When news about our rejection to his plan arrived Premier Jack Lang, he was not pleased. With him declaring our decision an act of submission to pro-austerity forces in the opposition, he has taken the choice to leave Labor.\n\nAlong with most of the New South Wales branch of Labor, Lang has established his own Lang Labor. With Labor losing control of one of the core state in the Commonwealth, our power is greatly weakened. While Labor's caucus in the House is still bigger than the Nationalist caucus, our absolute majority has been lost. Wonder if this is what Jack Lang wishes."

australia.16.t: "Western Australia Ruin"
australia.16.d: "Out of all the states and territories making up Australia, none has battered this economic crisis worse than Western Australia. With the agricultural industries of the state at an halt and the mining industries dried up by the crisis, the state has seen immense economic ruin in just a couple of weeks.\n\nThe people of Western Australia grows more and more alienated from the rest of Australia, proven by increased activity in the Auralia separatist movement. Both far-left and far-right Australian republicans have used this moment to stir up discontent in the western state. Even our MPs from Western Australia is affected, with them easier in believing that the Federal government has wronged the state."

australia.17.d: "As the 1937 General Elections are fast approaching, there are whispers of pessimism within the Labour MPs that the party would not survive the election. The recent London Stock Market Crash and the government's handling of the situation has extremely damaged it's reputation to the voter base, and the people have been blaming the Scullin Government for not doing enough for handle the economic situation. Some within the party ranks are even considering asking for Prime Minister James Scullin to resign as leader of the party, in order for Labour to survive the election, however, it comes to the Prime Minister himself to address these motions."

australia.19.t: "Opposition to Wage Cuts"
australia.19.d: "As part of the austerity measures introduced in Joseph Lyon's economic recovery plan, the government have decided to decrease the wages of various public workers which then also affected the workers in the private sector. This move have been critized by the ACTU or the Australian Council of Trade Unions, implying that the average worker have been left struggling in this economic catastrophe. Many are demanding that the government reverse this decision, particularly former Labour members in the left wing amplified by the ACTU."
australia.19.a: "They have to deal with it."
australia.19.b: "Now gentlemen, we can work this out."

australia.20.t: "ACTU Announces General Strike"
australia.20.d: "Various factory workers all over the Confederation walked off the job today, organising an illegal strike that prompted swift police reaction. This strike has been a response on the government's ignoring the ACTU's demands to rescind the Wage Cuts policies in the Austerity plan for recovering in the London Market Crash. The strikers, have barricaded themselves in front of their local factory gates and were issued an ultimatum to disperse - which they ignored. Violence quickly escalated when the police moved in, and the resulting riot ended with over thirty badly injured. Within a week, the factory workers were back on the job... now supervised by private militia soldiers, to ensure no further demonstrations."
australia.20.a: "The unions are always the ones stirring up trouble."

australia.21.t: "Kavanagh Gives Speech"
australia.21.d: "Prominent ACTU leader Jack Kavanagh gave a speech that drew a very large crowd as well as media attention in Sydney today. Kavanagh spoke of the need for an 'open dialogue' between the unions and the government, and that there was no need to fear the brand of democracy that syndicalism brought. The speech was branded by some as the 'ramblings of a radical', though many others said that Kavanagh's well-spoken manner earned him many new supporters."

australia.22.t: "Socialist March in Canberra"
australia.22.d: "Many radicals supported by the Australian Council of Trade Unions have held an illegal march in several of Australia's cities, even in the capital, Canberra. In Canberra, many police units have been slow to react to ongoing marching of the protesters, and have led to the protesters successfully entering and vandalizing the parliament house, even capturing prominent politicians as hostages. As a response, the army have seen a battalion to suppress and disperse the radical protesters and in the tense situation have been..."

australia.23.t: "ACTU Celebrates Deal"
australia.23.d: "The new Workers' Deal enacted by the government has been a great cause for celebration among Australia's working class - and the Australian Council of Trade Unions specifically has led marches across several large cities to commemorate the historic occasion. Speeches by ACTU leaders drew massive crowds, where they spoke with obvious fervour about syndicalist ideals and the true interests of the working class. Police stood nearby, keeping back agitators who hurled slurs at the socialists, and there were no reports of incidents."
australia.23.a: "I see..."

australia.24.t: "Australian Guard Prepares for Confrontation"
australia.24.d: "The government has received word of rather peculiar movements of elements within the military especially units loyal to the royalist movement called the Australian Guard, headed by two heroes of the Great War, Eric Campbell and Thomas Blamey.

While the [AST.GetAdjective] government is outraged by our interference, we are not at war with them yet... though Blamey claims to have the support of the New Zealand government and tells us they will be rising up soon.

australia.36.t: "Rise of the AFM"
australia.36.d: "Up until this point, the Australia First Movement - led by Percy Stephensen - has been considered a fringe movement filled with disaffected socialists. With the rise of chaos inspired by syndicalist forces, and with it the fortunes of the Australian Guard, Stephensen's words have gained new purchase among the people of Australia. Stephensen calls for Australia to cut its ties with the British crown, to further promote Australianism and to maintain a neutral stance in global affairs so to ensure Australia never marches into another disaster like Gallipoli. 'They talk grandiloquently about 'filling up Australia's vast empty spaces' and then they dump down the scum of London here,' he tells his ardent supporters, 'To hell with the British and the Empire!'"

Because of intense heat and drought over the last few years, much of rural Victoria has dried up - leaving plenty of fuel for the flames. The fires at this point are so incredibly intense that the ash and smoke can be seen from New Zealand. Firefighters with the aid of the state government are currently trying to combat the disaster, with the flames already threatening several major cities and causing considerable panic."
australia.37.a: "Goodness!"

australia.38.t: "Bush Fires Finally Extinguished"
australia.38.d: "The fires in Victoria have finally been extinguished, thanks to the efforts of local fire fighters as well as overdue dense rainfall. This victory has come at the cost of 71 lives, over 1000 homes destroyed, and the burning of almost 135,500 hectares of land. Currently Judge Leonard Stretton has been selected to lead a royal commission into what led to the disastrous fires, though many suspect farmers or graziers in rural areas to be responsible due to their long-standing practice of burning brush to clear new land."

It follows the life of recently-deceased Sir Sidney Kidman, an entrepreneur and pastoralist who owned or co-owned large areas of land in Australia in his lifetime. Kidman became widely popular due to his support of the government in the Great War and charitable organisations. The book looks set to be Australasia's best-seller for 1936, and many are drawing parallels between Kidman and the exiled White Rajah, Charles Vyner Brooke, which is sure to boost Brooke's popularity."
australia.40.a: "An Interesting Read!"

australia.41.t: "'Forty Thousand Horsemen'"
australia.41.d: "Directed by Charles Chauvel, 'Forty Thousand Horsemen' tells the story of the Australian Light Horse during the Sinai and Palestine Campaign of the last Great War. It follows the adventures of three rowdy heroes in fighting and romance and culminates at the Battle of Beersheba. While the film is clearly a propaganda tool to aid in recruitment and lift the pride of Australasians at home, it is fast becoming the most successful Australasian film ever produced."
australia.41.a: "Wow!"

australia.42.t: "Socialist Cells Uncovered"
australia.42.d: "Finally some good news today as three separate cells of socialist agitators were uncovered in major [Root.GetAdjective] cities. Over fifty arrests were made, with public trials expected within weeks, a true blow to the socialist movement. There are some, however, who have expressed dismay at how quickly the socialist have organised, and suggest that these cells may simply be a few of many in [Root.GetNameDef]."
australia.42.a: "Well, it's certainly a start."

australia.43.t: "The Dissolution Of The Australasian Guard"
australia.43.d: "Today Eric Campbell and Thomas Blamey, both veterans of the Great War and perpetrators of the Australian Guard's attempted coup d'état, were sentenced to life imprisonment by the High Court of Australia for high treason. The leadership of the Guard and its political wing the Centre Party, shares the same fate along with many other prominent members. The Centre Party has been dissolved and the Australasian Guard more or less ended as a political force in Austrasia. Charles Vyner Brooke unfortunately could not be linked directly to the coup and so escaped a prison sentence, although many accuse him of bribing those involved in his prosecution."
australia.43.a: "Good Riddance!"

australia.44.t: "Unions Protest Suppression"
australia.44.d: "Union supporters have taken to the streets in several major Australasian cities, protesting the government's decision to continue the suppression of the ACTU and its syndicalist allies. The protesters were met with police, and later with Australasian Guard paramilitary groups, and this led to bloody clashes in Melbourne where dozens were reported injured. Maximist leader J.B. Miles has called for continued resistance to the government's anti-union policies, although he drew short of openly calling for armed revolt."

POLITICS_LORD_BIRDWOOD_DESC: "Lord Birdwood, whose full name is William Riddell Birdwood, was a prominent British military leader and field marshal. Born on September 13, 1865, in the Northumberland region of England, Birdwood's life was intertwined with a remarkable military career that spanned over four decades. He initially joined the British Army in 1885, and his early years were marked by service in various colonial campaigns, including the Sudan and South Africa. However, Birdwood is primarily remembered for his exceptional leadership during the Great War.\n\nDuring the Great War, Birdwood commanded the Australian and New Zealand Army Corps (ANZAC) in the Gallipoli Campaign, which began in 1915. His strategic prowess and unwavering commitment to his troops earned him great respect and admiration. Despite the campaign's ultimate failure, Birdwood's leadership and concern for his soldiers' welfare made him an iconic figure in the ANZAC legend. He later commanded the British Fifth Army on the Western Front and played a pivotal role in several major battles, including the Battle of the Somme."
