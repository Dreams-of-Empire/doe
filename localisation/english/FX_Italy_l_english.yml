### History
ITA_FUHRERREDUX_DESC: "The Great War pushed Italy to her breaking point. Despite standing as one of the victorious powers following the conflict the nation was on brink of a civil war. Radical groups on both ends of the political spectrum were pushing for conflicting societal changes that threatened to tear the nation apart. Compromise between the Socialists and the newly founded PPI brought much needed reforms to Italy but many of the core conflicts of this era still remain."

ITA_soldier_king: "The Soldier King"
ITA_soldier_king_desc: "The "Soldier King" reminds the Italians of their recent victories in the Great War.

ITA_colonial_administration: "Colonial Overextension"
ITA_colonial_administration_desc: "After the Great War Italy was awarded many new colonial holdings but they are very expensive to maintain. Libya, our largest colony, has been embroiled in the devastating guerrilla conflict since the early 1920’s. Until some sort of solution can be found to bring this war to an end a massive garrison will be needed to keep Libya from slipping out of Italy’s grasp"

ITA_decentralization_conservative: "Autonomy for Sicily"
ITA_decentralization_conservative_desc: "The Island of Sicily has for a long time been under Spanish control and with many differences from the mainland. When we proclaimed a united Italian state, criminal organisations and bandit squads started to form in Sicily. Those bandits and mafias then started to spread and increase in power. Most of the bandits were eventually defeated by the Central Government, but the criminal organisations became smarter and started to work in secret. To this day, the Mafia is still an issue and the language differences are a barrier to say the least. With the newest resolution passed by congress, Sicily will be granted more autonomy to give their people better representation and to hopefully wake up the Sicilians and make them fight the Mafia."
ITA_decentralization: "Regional Decentralization"
ITA_decentralization_desc: "The lands of our nation have always been divided in some way since the fall of Rome. First the nation was divided between longobards and Byzantines, then the Franks came and took their slice. The Spanish also wanted a piece and in the end, the Austrians couldn't resist either. Centuries of foreign occupation made our people speak, act, or sometimes even look different. Now that Italy is one, we need to acknowledge those differences and make them our strength. After various talks at the parliament, and the approval of the King, regions will be formed. Each region will have special powers given by the constitution that they must respect. The newly formed regions are Abruzzi-Molise, Basilicata, Calabria, Campania, Dalmazia, Emilia-Romagna, Friuli Venezia Giulia, Lazio, Liguria, Lombardia, Marche, Piemonte, Puglia, Sardegna, Sicilia, Toscana, Trentino Alto Adige, Umbria, Valle D'Aosta and Veneto."

Sadly not many Italian soldiers were able to make the journey to North Africa and the locals do not sympathize with our cause, both of which have led to a severe lack of manpower."

ITA_political_radicalization_desc: "Despite once being a source of stability for Italy, the Italian People's Party lead coalition that has been in power since the early 1920’s has begun to lose the support of the people.

ita.0.t: "The Kingdom of Italy"
ita.0.d: "In 1914 as Europe was finding itself embroiled in the first major war of the 20th century Italy remained neutral, at least initially. The Pact of London promised Italy land in the Balkans in exchange for military support against the Central Powers of Germany and Austria-Hungary. With this agreement Italy had joined Entente Cordiale dragging her people into war that many were sure would be over by Christmas. Despite seemingly being on the edge of collapse after several recent defeats Austria-Hungary put up a formidable defense against the Italians. The Italian front collapsed into the same stalemate as seen in France. It took the Entente until 1919 to defeat the Central Powers but even as a victor Italy was not unscathed. \n\nSocial strife that had been building in Italy for years exploded as soldiers returning from the front were welcomed back to a home that could not provide for them. As Italy's economy crashed the Socialists, emboldened by the Russian Revolution, occupied the factories and fought to police, an era now known as the 'Red Biennium'. In response the Nationalists formed their own 'Squadre d'Aziones' as a paramilitary force to deal with this threat. As the prospect of civil war grew on the horizon the time for compromise and reform was needed more than ever. The once united Socialist party was divided on how to proceed in their goal to liberate the workers leading to Amedeo Bordiga and Antonio Gramsci to break off and form the Communist Party of Italy. The left wing of Italy never recovered from this division allowing the recently formed Italian People's Party lead by the clerical socialist Luigi Sturzo to make compromises with the more moderate Italian Socialist party. Several reforms supported by both parties expanded the rights of the workers within Italy including the right to vote for all Italian adults as well as legal protections for Italy's new minorities gained as a result of the Great War. \n\nWhile this era of compromise brought stability and economic growth to Italy through the 20's it's positive effect have begun to vanish. The PPI's 'Big tent' political stance no longer appeals to the party's demographic. Sturzo's left leaning politics have increasingly put him at odds with the party's catholic faction lead by the conservative Alcide De Gasperi. As the politics within Italy grow increasingly radical the PPI must adapt to the changing times or be lost to history."
ita.0.a: "Long Live Italy!"
#
ita.1.t: "Catholic Flight"
ita.1.d: "Luigi Sturzo's left leaning politics were seen as a breath of fresh air immediately after the Great War but as the need for reforms has dwindled within Italy the conservative Catholic faction of the PPI has made it's demands increasingly clear. Our compromises with the moderate Socialists is very unpopular with them, as they see Marxist theory to be antithetical to Catholic teachings. The growth of the far right movement in Italy is also seen by many as a sign that the nation is in need of a strong and reasonable conservative voice which fellow PPI deputy Alcide De Gasperi wishes to capitalize on. Struzo and his supporters though believe that compromise with the nationalists will only lead Italy to internal conflict as seen in the 'Red Biennium' of the early 20's."
ita.1.a: "The PPI must update it's politics, not abandon it's principles"
ita.1.b: "Gasperi does make some good points"
#
ita.2.t: "Pressure from the Socialist left"
ita.2.d: "The Social Democrats and Christian Socialists that have been a core of the PPI since the Red Biennium have begun to pressure the party to adopt more hard line progressive policies. Italy has made much progress in the last decade but it is still the poorest of the Great Powers. In Southern Italy poverty is rampant while the North has begun to face growing unemployment. The PPI must be committed to real political change if they wish to solve these issues."
ita.2.a: "we must be weary of sliding towards Communism"
ita.2.b: "We must promise reforms"
#
ita.3.t: "Agrarian Syndicates of South Italy"
ita.3.d: "The Mezzogiorno has been the agricultural core of Italy since the nation's foundation but the country has never managed to be self sufficient, requiring massive grain imports from France. Efforts by the PPI to help modernize Italian agriculture have helped alleviate this issue but at the expense of small farm owners who barely make enough to pay for their own land, let alone tools and machinery needed for modernization. As more established farming conglomerates continue to buy up farmland many farmers have found another solution. Throughout the south many farmers have joined the FISN founded Farming Syndicate, a union of sorts that aids it's members in financing land payments and machinery in attempt to slow down the monopolization of Italy's agriculture sector. While this National Syndicate is very popular with it's members it has become a breeding ground for far-right Nationalist thought and political violence, with several Syndicate members being tied to crimes against rival Socialist unions in the region as well as major privately owned institutions. Edmondo Rossoni, the secretary-general of the Confederation of National Syndicates, has made his support of direct action and political violence an open secret and clearly has no intention to keep his syndicates in line with the law. Several business owners have even petitioned the state to crack down on the Syndicate."
ita.3.a: "Unions of all kinds should be given equal protection"
ita.3.b: "The violence must be stopped"
#
ita.4.t: "The Fate of the PPI"
ita.4.d: "A recent meeting of delegates from the Partito Popolare Italiano came to a head as the growing Conservative and Progressive factions could not agree on a unified campaign direction for the upcoming election. Alcide de Gasperi even accused current PPI chairmen Luigi Stuzo of purposely undermining and dividing the party. Without a unified PPI the moderate coalition that has lead Italy since the 20's may fall apart letting the country fall into the hands of extremists."
ita.4.a: "Gasperi assumes leadership of the PPI and begins his reforms"
ita.4.b: "Sturzo remains as secretary, Gasperi abandons the PPI"
#
ita.5.t: "The Social Democrats abandon the PPI"
ita.5.d: "The PPI's attempt to force out the moderate socialists from their coalition has backfired as Giuseppe Saragat and the PSDI in an act of solidarity have decided to remove their entire party from the coalition rather then bend to Gasperi's demands. As part of the official opposition now it is unclear how the Social Democrats will proceed in the upcoming election but in any case this division does not bode well for Gasperi's reforms."
ita.5.a: "We don't need their support"
#
ita.6.t: "The Social Democrats agree to distance themselves from the socialists"
ita.6.d: "In an effort to solidify the PPI's ruling coalition, Chairmen Alcide de Gasperi has demanded Giuseppe Saragat to distance his party's politics from the Socialists. The Social democrats have agreed to this leading to several PSDI deputies to join the Italian Socialist Party but now our coalition will be stronger."
ita.6.a: "We can never compromise with socialists"
#
ita.8.t: "The Socialists attack our campaign in the North"
ita.8.d: "Our efforts to court the industrialists of Northern Italy have hit a roadblock as the growing Socialist movement of the region has diminished our credibility among many capitalists who see this political threat as a failure of our party to maintain the status quo. At the same time the Socialists have used the PPI's campaign for capitalist supporters as a talking piece to argue for stronger unions and increased worker solidarity."
ita.8.a: "Propaganda like this can't stand"
#
ita.9.t: "The National Syndicalists attack our campaign in the South"
ita.9.d: "Our mission to find political support among the growing farmer conglomerates of Southern Italy has sputtered out against heavy Syndicalist opposition. Several PPI allies in the region have been the victims of attacks and arson at the hands of the FISN militia, known locally as the 'Camicie Nere'. No arrests have been made as of yet but it is rumored that MVSN commander Attilio Teruzzi had ordered these attacks. For the time being at least it seems we will not be able to count on much vocal support in the region."
ita.9.a: "Damn those Fascists"
#
ita.11.t: "The PLI abandon our coalition"
ita.11.d: "The PPI's attempt to cater the growing socialist and progressive movements in Italy has not been popular with their liberal allies. Today The Italian Liberal Party chairmen Luigi Einaudi has announced his party's intention of leaving the PPI dominated coalition and officially join the conservative opposition. While the liberals have not been a major player in the Italian political scene since the end of the Great War their connections amongst the upper classes of Italy have made them a powerful ally."
ita.11.a: "Just 20 years and a liberal will become a conservative without changing a single idea"
#
ita.12.t: "The PSI join our Coalition"
ita.12.d: "Ever since the Red Biennium the Italian Socialists have been divided between the Italian Communist Party and The Italian Socialist Party. While they have been political allies since then strong ideological drifts have begun to push them apart. The socialists accuse the communists of being Soviet puppets while the communists accuse the socialists of betraying the Revolution. What is true doesn't matter for us as having this new political ally will surely only help us."
ita.12.a: "We will embrace them with open arms"
#
ita.13.t: "Moderate Socialists join the PPI"
ita.13.d: "As the PPI adopts more socially conscious policies many moderate socialists, especially the Christian Socialists, have begun to join our party. As the political situation in Moscow, the heart of leftist thought, becomes more chaotic many socialists are starting to feel alienated from their party whom under pressure from the Soviet Union continue to flip flop on their own policies."
ita.13.a: "We will embrace them with open arms"
#
ita.14.t: "The Foreign Policy question"
ita.14.d: "The first issue brought up in Parliament is the direction of our foreign policy. Conservative delegate, Alcide de Gasperi, argued that Italy should pursue a closer relation with members of the France. Palmiro Togliatti of the Communist Party alternatively stated that the Italian nation should leave the reactionary Entente and instead should align itself with the Soviet Union however his statement was not supported by the more moderate Socialists. The Liberals insisted that Italy should realign herself with Britain whose economy Italy is dependent on. Finally the Nationalists have argued that Italy is too dependent of foreign alliances and must cement herself as the ruler of the Mediterranean"
ita.14.a: "The USSR is the core of the Revolution, we should support them."
ita.14.b: "Togliatti is a fool, but he isn't completely wrong..."
ita.14.c: "The Liberals are right, Britain is a more sensible ally."
ita.14.e: "De Gasperi is right, we should support the Entente."
ita.14.f: "Italy must forge her own destiny."
#
ita.15.t: "The Suffragette question"
ita.15.d: "In the aftermath of the Red Biennium various reforms pushed by The PPI and the socialists led to women gaining the right to vote, but little more. Today the first Italian woman deputy, Lina Merlin, a member of the socialist party spoke for total equality. The Socialist applauded her speech, while the more conservative elements of the Italian parliament were shocked by her shameless prepotency."
ita.15.a: "Applaud her effort! Women are a cornerstone of the Revolution."
ita.15.b: "Commend her effort! We must always consider the perspective of Women."
ita.15.c: "Interesting but she's too radical."
ita.15.e: "Politics is no place for a woman."
ita.15.f: "Women should serve the state, not the other way around."
#
ita.16.t: "Rising organized crime"
ita.16.d: "In the last few years southern Italy and Sicily has seen a sharp rise in organized crime. Parliament is now forced to consider substantial reforms to combat this. Minister Luigi Sturzo, a Sicilian himself, in one of his few conservative leaning position has suggested in the past that giving Sicily more autonomy over it's own security would help the island region fight the Crime Families. Most of the democratic socialists wish to pursue a broader goal of decentralization for the regions of Italy. The Communist suggested to create Anti-Mafia militias squad to protect the people. The Liberals preferred to maintain the status quo but promised to fight organized crime. Finally the nationalists blame the organized crime on foreign influence especially that of the United States who's own Italian population has deep family connections with the Italian mob."
ita.16.a: "The Militia would wipe out all those Mafia scum!"
ita.16.b: "Decentralization is necessary for a state like Italy."
ita.16.c: "The current policies are working fine"
ita.16.e: "Luigi Sturzo had a few good ideas."
ita.16.f: "Italy must overcome these foreign forces"
#
ita.17.t: "Economic reforms"
ita.17.d: "After the Great War, Italy faced an economic depression and became deeply buried in debt. The PPI has achieved a slow recovery but Italians now demand more radical change. The leftist coalition is trying to push for the creation of a welfare state or "Stato Sociale". The Communist of course are pushing for collectivization and the redistribution of the means of production. Liberals and Conservatives both support mild state intervention only if needed. Finally the nationalists wish for Italy to become self sufficient, independent from the volatile market economies of the West."
ita.17.a: "We must seize the means of production!"
ita.17.b: "A welfare state would be the favorable option"
ita.17.c: "The economy is recovering fine"
ita.17.e: "Economic reform is a slippery slope towards Communism"
ita.17.f: "A push towards Autarky should be the goal for Italy"
#
ita.18.t: "The role of the Monarchy"
ita.18.d: "Since it's foundation Italy has been a constitutional monarchy. While the king has little de facto power his de jure influence has been a major controversy amongst the growing Republican movement. Many Italians blame their country's entrance into the Great War on Victor Emmanuel III, a conflict that nearly tore the country apart. Debate rages to this day on the role of the king within Italian politics. For once the Socialists and National Syndicalists agree that a modern state can't be held back by this Dark Age relic and have pressured the PPI for years for a referendum to establish a Republic, which the PPI and their centrist allies have continually blocked."
ita.18.a: "No Gods, No Kings, No Masters."
ita.18.b: "The King should maintain a ceremonial role."
ita.18.c: "The Constitution is clear on the issue."
ita.18.e: "The King's influence guarantees stability."
ita.18.f: "Italians need a powerful modern leader."
#
ita.19.t: "Our colonial policy"
ita.19.d: "In the last 30 years Italy's imperial borders have nearly doubled with the inclusion of Libya, Panfilia and Cameroon. This rapid expansion has put much strain on military and economy with no returns in sight. The socialists hold strong anti-imperialists views and wish to see Italy emancipate it's colonies. Most of the centrist parties want to keep investing in Italy's colonies, insistent the economic returns are surely around the corner. The Italian nationalists argue that Italy, as one of the great powers, is destined to hold and expand it's colonial realms."
ita.19.a: "Imperialism must be dismantled."
ita.19.b: "We will continue to protect our colonial subjects."
ita.19.c: "Imperialism improves the economies of the master and the subject."
ita.19.e: "Italy is only helping to civilize these lesser nations."
ita.19.f: "Italy has a right to an empire, as does any great power"
#
ita.20.t: "The Socialists have won"
ita.20.d: "In a surprise victory, the Socialist coalition have won the election. While the results are controversial little evidence of fraud can be found. This has not stopped many on the right from protesting against the party though. Many are worried that this is the end of Italian democracy as we know it and some even claim that a one party Communist state is right around the corner but the socialists and their supporters deny this and only seek to reform the Italian economy and emancipate the working class."
ita.20.a: "Congratulations Comrades."
#
ita.21.t: "The Progressives have won"
ita.21.d: "The progressive coalition has won a majority in the election. As more Italians flock to the extremes of the political spectrum it has become clear that real reforms are needed to solve Italy's issues. The progressive in both the PSDI and PPI wish decrease the gap between the rich and the poor and legislate sensible protections for Italy's working class."
ita.21.a: "In times like these meaningful reforms are needed."
#
ita.22.t: "The Liberals have won"
ita.22.d: "For the last 20 years the Liberals in Italy have only held a minor position within Italy's political scene despite once being it's dominant party. It seems now as Italy's politics becomes more radical our citizens want a return to the sensible status quo seen before the Great War. Both the PLI and PDL seek to support Italy's industrialists through subsidies and foreign investment, who's profits will trickle down to the lower classes of society."
ita.22.a: "We must not let extremist tear Italy apart."
#
ita.23.t: "The Conservatives have won"
ita.23.d: "As extremists continue to tear Italy apart it is clear that Italians are seeking strong sensible leaderships that can unite the nation. A conservative coalition now seeks, with the support of the monarchy, to bring stability to Italy and unite the nation through catholic and democratic ideals."
ita.23.a: "Long Live Italy!"
#
ita.24.t: "The Nationalists have won"
ita.24.d: "For decades the Italian liberal democracy has brought suffering to the people of Italy with nothing to show for it. Despite sacrificing nearly everything in the Great War most Italians are no better off than before the conflict. Italy has been the core of Western Civilization for over 2 millennia but has recently fallen from that position, being overshadowed by the powers of Northern Europe. The Nationalist coalition now seeks for Italy to return to her position as the dominate power of Europe, independent from the parasitic influence of her neighbors."
ita.24.a: "Credere, obbedire, combattere"
#
ita.25.t: "No coalition wins a majority"
ita.25.d: "The 1936 Italian Election was shaping up to be one of the most important in our nation's history but it seems political divisions have split the voter base. No party can claim a decisive win and many are already disputing the results. Victor Emmanuel III has had to personally step in and give his support to the existing PPI lead coalition, whom will continue to lead the government. For now the future of Italy is uncertain but the situation looks grim."
ita.25.a: "Dio salvi il re!"
#
ita.26.t: "Socialists take up arms"
ita.26.d: "The political crisis that followed the recent disputed election results has caused much anxiety amongst the Italian people. What originally started as a general strike has morphed into a Revolution as fears of a far right takeover spread across North Italy. Palmiro Togliatti has taken leadership of this revolt and has used the opportunity to declare the founding of the Socialist Republic of Italy, the successor to the Kingdom of Italy. As Red Militias continue their terror over Northern Italy Italian patriots are ready to serve their country to crush this insurrection."
ita.26.a: "To Arms!"
#
ita.27.t: "Nationalists take up arms"
ita.27.d: "The political crisis that followed the recent disputed election results has influenced several military officers lead by Italo Balbo to initiate a coup against the government in Rome. They argue that this drastic action is needed to 'Secure stability' for Italy and protect her people against the 'rising Socialist menace' but most deputies in Rome see this coup as an attempt to install Balbo's National Syndicalist in power and dismantle Italy's Constitutional Monarchy. Most of our army has stayed loyal to the Parliament and the King and are ready to put down this insurrection."
ita.27.a: "To Arms!"
#
ita.28.t: "Civil War in Italy"
ita.28.d: "Political instability in Italy has exploded into all out civil conflict. Socialists all across Northern Italy have taken up arms to overthrow the democratic government and install a dictatorship of the proletariat. Within our own country there are fears that this violence might spill over into France which has prompted many ministers to give their support for direct military intervention on the side of our Italian ally. A vocal minority though has countered this pro war sentiment arguing that an open conflict will only hurt our nation and damage our economy, Which Germany will surely take advantage of."
ita.28.a: "We will support Italy"
ita.28.b: "We will remain neutral"
#
ita.29.t: "Civil War in Italy"
ita.29.d: "Political instability in Italy has exploded into all out civil conflict. Fears of a socialist takeover has motivated the FISN lead by Gabriele D'annunzio to overthrow the government in Rome to 'secure national stability'. In Paris many ministers worry that this conflict may threaten our holdings in the Mediterranean and North Africa and they argue we should support our ally. Several ministers though believe supporting the FISN against Rome may secure us a more stable ally that would be more manageable. A vocal minority though has countered this pro war sentiment arguing that an open conflict will only hurt our nation and damage our economy, Which Germany will surely take advantage of."

ita.30.d: "As France's ally the government of Italy assumed that they would have their full support but Paris has announced that France will remain neutral in the Italian conflict, citing their own national security concerns for the reason why. As bad as this total betrayal is there are rumors that France may even be supporting the opposing side."
ita.30.a: "Damn them!"
#
ita.31.t: "French Volunteers"
ita.31.d: "Political instability in Italy has only served to weaken the Entente alliance. France believes that our Coup will bring much needed stability to the Mediterranean and as such they have sent 2 volunteer divisions to support us."

#
ita.32.t: "The Fate of Italy's colonies"
ita.32.d: "The Civil war in Italy has put her colonies in a precarious situation. With diminishing help from Rome local authorities are powerless to stop growing independence movements. A possible collapse of the Italian Empire may spill over into our own colonies with disastrous results. It has been suggested by our own colonial authorities that France should occupy these colonies for at least the time being to help secure local order."

ita.34.t: "Pressure the new Italian Government"
ita.34.d: "It is no secret that the inner circle of the new Italian Government harbors many extremist elements such as National Syndicalist officer Italo Balbo. If we want to secure Italy as a subservient ally we must pressure the new government to distance itself from these individuals and to install a more popular leader. Prince Amedeo, Duke of Aosta is supported by many nationalists and centrists factions and is a beloved royal celebrity amongst the Italian people. Having him become the head of state for the new Italy will hopefully bring stability to the nation as well as giving us an unproven leader that we can easily coerce."
ita.34.a: "Pressure Rome"
ita.34.b: "Lets not push the new regime too much"
#
ita.35.t: "Invite Italy back into the Entente?"

ita.35.a: "Lets not waste our efforts"
#
ita.36.t: "France invites us into the Entente"
ita.36.d: "France has invited Italy to rejoin the Entente. While France's support was key in helping us to secure Italy there are fears that Paris may be using our nations instability for their own personal gain."
ita.36.a: "France has shown us her good will"
ita.36.d: "France should not be trusted"
#
ita.37.t: "Italy has rejoined"
ita.37.d: "The new government in Rome has shown it's willingness to cooperate with us and has brought Italy back into the Entente"
ita.37.a: "Cheers to Italy"
#
ita.38.t: "Italy refuses to rejoin"
ita.38.d: "Despite our support for their coup the new government in Rome refuses to join the Entente or cooperate with us in anyway."
ita.38.a: "Damn them!"
#
ita.39.t: "France demands government reforms"
ita.39.d: "France has sent our government what can only be described as an ultimatum in which they demand that the Italian government expel so called 'extremist elements' such as commander Italo Balbo. The demands also state that we should install the popular duke Amadeo Aosta as the head of state. France states that these major reforms are needed to stabilize our regime but it's suspected that these demands are only intended to weaken our government and make our nation completely dependent on France."
ita.39.a: "France surely has our best interests in mind"
ita.39.b: "Damn the French"
#
ita.40.t: "Italy accepts our demands"
ita.40.d: "The new government in Rome has accepted our demands and has installed Amadeo Aosta as their Head of State."
ita.40.a: "Finally a dependable ally "

ita.41.t: "Italy refuses our demands"
ita.41.d: "The new government in Rome has refused to institute any of our demands"
ita.41.a: "Damn them!"
#
ita.42.t: "France occupies Italian Colonies"
ita.42.d: "France has announced today their occupation of Italy's colonial holdings. They state that this action was to secure order within the colonies and protect the local populace from the effects of the war in Italy and is not a permanent annexation. No matter your interpretation this action is a massive insult to Italian sovereignty and we shall not stand for it."
ita.42.a: "Damn them!"
#
ita.43.t: "Italy's Destiny"
ita.43.d: "It is clear that France is falling behind her rival of Germany, dragging us down with them. It is time that we reassess our relationship with France and possibly even align ourselves with the growing German titan. France has shown time and time again they only seek to undermine Italy. It is time to make our own destiny"
ita.43.a: "We don't need France"
ita.43.b: "France isn't that bad"
#
ita.44.t: "Italy leaves the Entente"
ita.44.d: "Despite our continued support for their regime Italy has announced it's intention to leave the Entente and pursue a more neutral foreign policy"
ita.44.a: "Damn them!"
#
ita.45.t: "Join Stahlpakt?"
ita.45.d: "As the Second Great War rages on in the battlefields of France it is clear that Germany will soon the be the victor. It would be a permanent stain on our history if we were to be left out of this momentous victory and allow the Germans full control of our claims on France."
ita.45.a: "We must join the Germans"
ita.45.b: "Our nation isn't ready for war"
#
ita.46.t: "The National Republic of Italy wishes to join Stahlpakt"
ita.46.d: "As our armies push into France Italy wishes to open a 2nd front on France's southern border. While this would surely hasten France's collapse many of our generals believe that the German army alone will be more than able to defeat France."
ita.46.a: "We must have the 2nd Front"
ita.46.b: "Our Generals don't need the help"
#
ita.47.t: "Germany accepts us into Stahlpakt"
ita.47.d: "Germany has officially accepted us into Stahlpakt. Right now our armies are preparing to open a front against France on their southern border. With German assistance the war in France will be over soon and we will have earned our place in the peace conference."
ita.47.a: "A toast to our German ally"
#
ita.48.t: "Germany refuses our Stahlpakt membership"
ita.48.d: "It seems that Germany has no interest in opening a second front against France and has refused our membership into Stahlpakt. Despite this many Italian Generals still believe that we should invade France and occupy our disputed territories before Germany gets a hold of them."
ita.48.a: "We should remain neutral"
ita.48.b: "We must occupy our rightful territory"
#
ita.49.t: "Christian Democrats align with the Nationalists"
ita.49.d: "With the PPIs recent drift to the left much of the right wing of Italy is nervous about a possible socialist takeover of the country. The Red Biennium is s recent memory for many Italians and most are not seeking to relive it. In this rapidly changing era in Italian politics the recently formed Christian Democratic Party, lead by former PPI member Alcide de Gasperi, have begun making in roads with the nationalists. It is suspected that they may even form their own coalition to oppose our party. Gasperi who has championed himself as a moderate believes that his party's action was needed if traditional Italian cultured is to be preserved."

#
ita.53.t: "Italy leaves the Entente"
ita.53.d: "Italian Prime Minister Italo Balbo has announced today that Italy would annul its alliance with France and seek an independent foreign policy. As the threat of German rearmament continues to grow this division in Western Europe will surely embolden Berlin."
ita.53.a: "Damn"
#
ita.54.t: "Our disputes with France"
ita.54.d: "Italy and France have only been allies for just barely 2 decades. While the Entente seemed like an obvious choice for Italy back in 1915, today territorial disputes threaten to tear this alliance apart. As nationalist sentiment grows within Italy it's clear we can no longer let these issues be ignored. Nearly a million Italians live under French rule with no autonomy to protect their culture. In Africa the French have done their best to prevent Italian influence from growing, such as forcing the assimilation of Italian settlers in Tunisia who even to this day still out number French settlers in the region. On top of this many within Italy doubt France's ability to defend Europe from German aggression, going as far to say that an alliance with France is akin to a suicide pact. If we are to continue our current relationship with France we must settle these issues."
ita.54.a: "We must reach a compromise."
ita.54.b: "The time for compromise is over. We must forge our own destiny."
#
ita.55.t: "Franco-Italian Territorial Conference"
ita.55.d: "It's been no secret that for decades factions within Italy have pushed for more Italian influence over French territory. Today Rome has invited us to discuss these and several other disputes and while they assure us these discussions will be non binding it's clear that they could have major ramifications over the Entente alliance as a whole. Very few within France would dare to cede anything to Italy but as their ally it may be in our interests to at least hear them out."
ita.55.a: "We must listen to our ally"
ita.55.b: "It's not the time for more territorial revisionism"
#
ita.56.t: "The Italian Minority In France"
ita.56.d: "For centuries Italians have lived in regions now apart of Metropolitan France. First in 1769 France annexed the island of Corsica but even more recently in 1860 the Duchy of Savoy and County of Nice, which had been historically Italian, were ceded by Peidmont-Sardinia to France for support in the former's goal to unite the Italian peninsula. While this may have been advantageous at the time many now see this as a clearly unequal treaty. Italy's official stance on the fate of these territories and the Italians within them has been vague to say the least. While some want the reannexation of Savoy and Nice most would rather see France guarantee them and their Italian culture legal protection and autonomy or maybe even a population exchange."
ita.56.a: "We must settle this issue"
ita.56.b: "It's not of grave importance"
#
ita.57.t: "The Fate Italian Diaspora"
ita.57.d: "in 1860 the Treaty of Turin peacefully ceded the territories of Savoy and Nice to France from Peidmont-Sardinia. While this was seen as fair for both sides at the time in retrospect some within Italy see this treaty as highly unfair. While the majority within these regions are French a sizable Italian minority does live within the area. Rome wishes for us to guarantee this population as well as the Italians in Corsica special legal rights and autonomy. Some within Italy wish to see more drastic action such as a population transfer between our 2 nations."
ita.57.a: "We shall give these Italians special protection"
ita.57.b: "We will support a population transfer"
ita.57.c: "These communities are French"
#
ita.58.t: "France will give special protections for local Italians"
ita.58.d: "As a reliable ally the French have heard our pleas and will grant Italians communities living in France special legal protections while stopping all attempts to assimilate them towards French culture."
ita.58.a: "A sensible choice for France"
#
ita.59.t: "France refuses to acknowledge it's Italian population"
ita.59.d: "The bull headed French have insulted us. They deny the Italian presence within Savoy, Nice or even Corsica claiming these people are French despite whatever local dialects they may speak."
ita.59.a: "How barbaric"
#
ita.60.t: "The Suez Canal"
ita.60.d: "Our colonies in Eastern Africa are entirely dependent on shipments that go through the Suez Canal. While the British government own a 44% stake in the company, Private French investors own the remaining stock. This situation puts our East African colonies in a vulnerable position. Any goods coming from Italy must pass through the canal and pay a toll, a toll that we have no control or influence over. This issue could be settled by asking the French to give an Italian representative a seat at the company's board of directors, which would give our nation a say over the policies of the Suez Canal."
ita.60.a: "We must have dependable access to the east"
ita.60.b: "It's not of grave importance"
#
ita.61.t: "Italy wants influence over the Suez Canal Company"
ita.61.d: "While the largest single owner of the Suez Canal is the British government with a 44% stake in the company, Private French investors own the remaining stock. This situation puts Italy and her East African colonies in a vulnerable position. Any goods coming from Italy must pass through the canal and pay a toll, a toll that Italy has no control or influence over. Rome suggests that this issue could be settled by giving an Italian representative a seat at the company's board of directors. While this solution would surely satisfy Italy It would shrink the influence of the French officials within the company and possible lower future income from Italian shipping."
ita.61.a: "We will allow an Italian representative"
ita.61.b: "There will be no reform to the company"
#
ita.62.t: "France will give us a seat at the Suez Canal Company"
ita.62.d: "The French have honored our reasonable request and will allow and Italian representative to sit at the Suez Canal Company's board of directors."
ita.62.a: "A sensible action"
#
ita.63.t: "France refuses our requests for more influence over the Suez Canal Company"
ita.63.d: "The stubborn French have refused our requests saying that they do not wish reform the company at this time."
ita.63.a: "Damn them!"
#
ita.64.t: "The security of Austria"
ita.64.d: "Since the collapse of Austria-Hungary, Austria exists only as a minor alpine state with little say on the European stage. While the Treaty of Versailles guarantees their sovereignty, German nationalist sentiment is growing within the country and is threatening to form a union with Germany which would once again open up our northern border to invasion. Economic recession in France though is creating doubt within Italy whether or not Paris will stand by their guarantee to Austria. For the sake of our own national security Austria must remain a buffer state with Italo-French protection."
ita.64.a: "We must get support for our northern border"
ita.64.b: "It's not of grave importance"
#
ita.65.t: "Italy seeks a guarantee for Austria"
ita.65.d: "The Treaty of Versailles states that the nation of Austria shall permanently remain independent from Germany but nationalist sentiment in both those countries is threatening a German lead annexation of Austria. This has many in Italy worried, as their Northern Border was decimated by Austro-German troops in the Great War. Rome now wishes for the both of us to once again publicly reaffirm our guarantee to Austria's sovereignty."
ita.65.a: "We will protect Austria"
ita.65.b: "We can't make any promises"
#
ita.66.t: "France promises to protect Austria"
ita.66.d: "France has once again made firm their commitment to stand by the Treaty of Versailles and all of it's stipulations and will protect Austria's independence as needed."
ita.66.a: "We can rest easy knowing our northern border will be secure"
#
ita.67.t: "France makes no promises over the Austria issue"
ita.67.d: "France has seemingly turned around on their once firm stance on the Treaty of Versailles and will make no promise over the \"Austria Issue\". Apparently the see appeasement as the better way to deal with Germany."
ita.67.a: "The threat of Germany may force us to reconsider our relationship with France"
#
ita.68.t: "Control over the Ababa-Djibouti railroad"
ita.68.d: "Built by French engineers the Ababa-Djibouti railroad is Ethiopia's main connection to the outside world. If we are to help spur development over this region we will need ownership of this railway and access to the major port in Djibouti."
ita.68.a: "The growth of Italian East Africa is destined by this railroad"
ita.68.b: "It's not of grave importance"
#
ita.69.t: "Italy demands control over the Ababa-Djibouti railroad"
ita.69.d: "Built by French engineers the Ababa-Djibouti railroad is Ethiopia's main connection to the outside world. In wake of their recent conquest of the region the Italians wish to control this railway to help speed up the rebuilding of their newest colony."
ita.69.a: "We will transfer control"
ita.69.b: "It will remain French property"
#
ita.70.t: "France agrees to hand over control of the Ababa-Djibouti railroad"
ita.70.d: "Seeing the dire state that Ethiopia has ended up in the French have agreed to transfer control of this railway to Italian colonial authorities."
ita.70.a: "This will surely help our situation in East Africa"
#
ita.71.t: "France refuses to hand over control of the Ababa-Djibouti railroad"
ita.71.d: "Despite seeing their fellow imperialist power in need of support the French have refused to transfer ownership of the Ababa-Djibouti railroad."
ita.71.a: "Damn them"
#
ita.72.t: "A free port at Djibouti"
ita.72.d: "Djibouti is the largest and most developed region in all of East Africa. Our colonies in the region are heavily dependent on shipments that pass through this colony, a fact that the French take full advantage off. If we are to ever see our colonies become self sufficient we have access to a free port within this region."
ita.72.a: "The growth of Italian East Africa is destined by this single region"
ita.72.b: "It's not of grave importance"
#
ita.73.t: "Italian request control a free port at Djibouti"
ita.73.d: "Djibouti is the economic hub of East Africa, a fact well know by the Italians. As their influence grows in the region the need for a more direct connection back to Italy shall become dire. Rome request a free port in the region to help spur economic growth within their own colonies."
ita.73.a: "We shall grant them a free port"
ita.73.b: "Djibouti is too important"
#
ita.74.t: "France grants us a free port at Djibouti"
ita.74.d: "The French have gladly heard our needs and have granted us rights to a free port in their colony of Djibouti"
ita.74.a: "A wise choice"
#
ita.75.t: "France refuses to grant us a free port at Djibouti"
ita.75.d: "Despite hearing the dire needs of our East African colonies the selfish French have refused to help us in anyway."
ita.75.a: "Damn them"
#
ita.76.t: "A Condominium over Tunisia"
ita.76.d: "For our last issue we must discuss the future of Tunisia with France. The invasion and eventual annexation of this region by the French has been controversial to say the least. The so called \"Schiaffo di Tunisi\" as it has become known created heavy tensions between France and Italy. In 1881 when the French invaded Italian settlers made up the largest European community in the region, a fact that still stands true to this day despite French efforts to assimilate them. It's clear that Tunisia can never be separated from it's Italian influence. It has been suggested that to compromise with the French over this issue the creation of a Condominium over Tunisia in which both our nations would have equal influence could be set up."
ita.76.a: "We must have control over the 4th Shore"
ita.76.b: "It's not of grave importance"
#
ita.77.t: "Italy requests a Condominium over Tunisia"
ita.77.d: "Tunisia has been an imperial ambition of Italy for several decades now. Our two nations have disputed the rightful sovereignty of this land ever since we annexed it in 1881. Despite our uninterrupted control of Tunisia since then Italian nationalists still claim it as rightful Italian territory, sighting the large number of Italian settlers as well as it's strategic location for Italy. Today Italy has requested the creation of a condominium over Tunisia in which both our nations would have equal sovereignty over the region."
ita.77.a: "We can accept a Condominium"
ita.77.b: "We will not compromise our Empire"
#
ita.78.t: "France agrees to establish a Condominium over Tunisia"
ita.78.d: "Seeing the legitimacy of our claims in Tunisia, the French have agreed to form a Condominium over the region in which both our nations would share equal sovereignty."
ita.78.a: "A sensible decision"
#
ita.79.t: "France refuses to establish a Condominium over Tunisia"
ita.79.d: "Despite our strong claims the the region the stubborn French have refused to compromise over their imperial holding."
ita.79.a: "Damn them"
#
ita.80.t: "France refuses to attend any conference"
ita.80.d: "Despite our efforts to seek compromise with with the French is seems that their arrogance blinds them to any reasonable requests. As it stands now many in Italy are outraged over the actions of the French. It's clear that they only see our nations as a lesser partner in this alliance. If Italy is to stand amongst the great powers as an equal we may have to forge our own destiny without the influence of France."
ita.80.a: "France is not a worthy ally of Italy"
ita.80.b: "It's not the time to reevaluate our alliance"
#
ita.81.t: "France supports a population transfer"
ita.81.d: "In a surprise move the government of France wishes to settle the /"Italian Issue/" once and for all and has agreed to a population transfer. They will transfer Italians in Savoy, Nice and Corsica back to Italy and in return will transfer our local French minority in Aosta Valley and Northern Sardinia back to France. While some may see this as a drastic action it's a positive sign that France takes our grievances seriously."
ita.81.a: "A surprise decision but a welcomed one."
#
ita.82.t: "The Entente will protect Austria"
ita.82.d: "The Entente, at the behest of Italy, have made a joint declaration to guarantee to independence of Austria. As [GER.GetLeader] continues to revise the Treaty of Versailles and push for a Pan-Germanic foreign policy it seems the Entente is preparing to put their foot down on the issue. Austria must never become just another province of the [GER.GetName]."
ita.82.a: "We appreciate any support"
#
ita.83.t: "The collapse of Austria"
ita.83.d: "Despite both ours and France's guarantees to Austria it seems that Vienna has still fallen to foreign forces. The collapse of an independent Austria has left our Northern border vulnerable and may leave us open to a direct German invasion of our country. It's clear that France either lacks the ability or the will to protect Europe and under such circumstances we must contemplate our relationship with them. It may be in our best interests to adopt a neutral foreign policy to avoid another bloody stalemate on Italian soil but Germany seems willing to ignore neutrality if it's diplomatically inconvenient. The fate of Italy and Europe hangs in the balance, we must make our decision wisely."
ita.83.a: "Leaving France will only make us both vulnerable"
ita.83.b: "Neutrality will save our nation from bloodshed"
#
ita.84.t: "Italy abandons the Entente"
ita.84.d: "In the wake of Austria's collapse a crisis has developed in Rome. Most Italian ministers no longer have faith in France and the Entente's ability to protect Europe. Italy has decided to adopt a neutral foreign policy in the misguided hope that such an action will appease the war hawks in Berlin. The sudden collapse of the Entente has severely hurt the organization's standing with the international community and will surely embolden Germany. At least for now France must stand alone against the tyranny of Germany"
ita.84.a: "It was Austria now but our nations will be next"
#
ita.85.t: "Nationalist sentiment grows in Corsica"
ita.85.d: "The \"Partitu Corsu d'Azione\" has been a minor, almost forgettable, separatist force in Corsica for a few years now but recently a huge bump in party membership and Corsican nationalist sympathies in general are starting to cause concern for local French officials. Seemingly out of nowhere local Corsicans lead by nationalist Pietro Rocca have begun protesting French rule over the island. It will be some time before French authorities can crack down on this growing movement but in the mean time we must keep an eye on this situation."
ita.85.a: "What could be behind this?"
#
ita.86.t: "Italy sparks nationalist sentiment grows in Corsica"
ita.86.d: "The \"Partitu Corsu d'Azione\" has been a minor, almost forgettable, separatist force in Corsica for a few years now but recently a huge bump in party membership and Corsican nationalist sympathies in general are starting to cause concern for local French officials. While this development initially appeared seemingly out of nowhere, a recently arrested Italian national with ties to Rome has confessed to being employed by Italy to spark and support this unrest. Despite the obviously fraudulent nature of the propaganda him and his fellow conspirators had been spreading local Corsicans lead by nationalist Pietro Rocca have begun protesting French rule over the island. It will be some time before French authorities can crack down on this growing movement but in the mean time we must keep an eye on the back stabbing Italians."
ita.86.a: "Damn those Italians!"
#
ita.87.t: "\"Partitu Corsu d'Azione\" leaders have been arrested"
ita.87.d: "The growing Corsican nationalist movement has hit a major dead end today as French authorities have arrested Pietro Rocca and his associates for conspiring against the state. His supporters are currently claiming that the charges against him are fraudulent and are currently campaigning for his release but most experts are convinced that without his active leadership the Corsican Independence movement is destined to fizzle out soon enough."
ita.87.a: "About time we bring this silly idea to an end"
ita.87.b: "We might have to be more direct in our efforts to take Corsica"
#
ita.89.t: "Corsican volunteers join Italy"
ita.89.d: "The war between France and Italy has convinced many Corsican nationalists to join the Italian cause in the hopes of liberating their homeland from French rule. Currently they are fighting French authorities on the island. It seems nearly certain that Italy will take advantage of this and occupy the island region unless French forces can quickly crack down on these rebels."
ita.89.a: "Corsica will be liberated soon enough"
ita.89.b: "Damn them"
#
ita.90.t: "Corsica declares independence"
ita.90.d: "The war between France and Italy has sparked a popular movement in Corsica demanding the independence of the region. Currently the newly formed Corsican government is fighting French authorities and loyalists on the island. It seems nearly certain that Italy will take advantage of this and occupy the island region unless French forces can quickly crack down on this rogue state."
ita.90.a: "Corsica will be liberated soon enough"
ita.90.b: "Damn them"
#
ita.91.t: "Fate of Corsica"
ita.91.d: "The actions of the provisional government of Corsica was key in securing the island region from French forces but now it is time to bring this core Italian territory under direct rule. While some in Corsica may have had the impression that they were going to remain autonomous most of the population see themselves as Italian and as such they deserve to become full Italian citizens."
ita.91.a: "An independent Corsica has served it's purpose"
ita.91.a: "Corsica has earned it's independence"
#
ita.92.t: "Italy claims our territory"
ita.92.d: "Today in a surprisingly hostile move the government of Rome has made official it's claims over several French territories and colonies. While these claims were held by fringe nationalist elements within Italy for decades they have finally been cemented as official government policy. It's not clear as of yet what his will mean for our two nations going forward but we can assume for now that Italy has no intention of seeking rapprochement with us."
ita.92.a: "We must keep an eye on this situation."
#
ita.93.t: "Italy denounces British influence in the Mediterranean"
ita.93.d: "British influence within the Mediterranean has been a contentious issue between us and Italy ever since the nation's founding in 1871. Access to the Mediterranean, either through Gibraltar or Suez, is firmly within our control which puts Italy in difficult position. Today though Italy has officially denounced what they describe as /"The British Monopoly/" over the Mediterranean. As a great power Rome says that Italians deserve uncontested access through /"Mare Nostrum/" and have hinted that they may seek territorial revisionism in the region if needed."
ita.93.a: "An unnecessarily hostile move"
#
ita.94.t: "Where to send our Navy?"
ita.94.d: "The Italian Navy is one of the finest in the world and greatly out matches the local British force based in the Mediterranean. A naval show of force will bring much prestige to our nation while forcing the British to the defensive. The British though are spread thin across the Mediterranean and to make full use of our naval power we will want to focus on a key strategic region.\n\nGibraltar is the opening to the Atlantic and is one of our largest shipping routes. If we want to secure access to the world's oceans we will want to show our dominance over this choke point.\n\nMalta has been a long time nationalist claim for Italy, as Maltese culture is strongly intertwined with Italian culture. On top of this it's strategic location in the center of the Mediterranean means it's a threat to many of our shipping lanes and may be used as a base to blockade us from Libya.\n\nFinally the British bases on Cyprus are dangerously close to our own territories in Anatolia. If war were to ever break out between us it's clear that Cyprus will be a major thorn in our side."
ita.94.a: "Send the Regia Marina to Gibraltar"
ita.94.b: "Send the Regia Marina to Malta"
ita.94.c: "Send the Regia Marina to Cyprus"
#
ita.95.t: "Italian warships sighted near Gibraltar"
ita.95.d: "A large Italian armada was spotted recently off the coast of Gibraltar. They made their presence explicitly clear to the local British forces but as quickly as they arrived they sailed back to Italy. It seems they were seeking to intimidate the local garrison as well as the Royal Navy in general. While the Italian Navy may be very dated compared to the Royal Navy we must not underestimate the threat."   
ita.95.a: "They are no threat to the Royal Navy"

ita.96.t: "Italian warships sighted near Malta"
ita.96.d: "A large Italian armada was spotted recently off the coast of Malta. They made their presence explicitly clear to the local British forces but as quickly as they arrived they sailed back to Italy. It seems they were seeking to intimidate the local garrison as well as the Royal Navy in general. While the Italian Navy may be very dated compared to the Royal Navy we must not underestimate the threat."
ita.96.a: "They are no threat to the Royal Navy"

ita.97.d: "A large Italian armada was spotted recently off the coast of Cyprus.

#
ita.99.t: "Italy offers to buy Malta"
ita.99.d: "Since the end of the Napoleonic Wars the island of Malta has been a British possession. It's strategic position in the center of the Mediterranean is a key factor to the United Kingdom's control of the region, a fact well understood by the Italians who have offered to purchase the island. In the past this offer would have been quickly ignored but with the recent economic downturn it may be in our best interests to consider it. While in the age of sail having Malta as a naval base was a sensible decision, the invention of aircraft such as naval bombers puts any ship stationed at the island in a vulnerable position. The Italians and French both have large air basses well in range of Malta. Few in Britain see value in defending Malta when the larger and much more secure base in Alexandria can be used. If we have any interest in rapprochement with the Entente we may want to agree to sell Malta along with it's dated naval bases."
ita.99.a: "We will accept the offer"
ita.99.b: "Malta is too important to surrender"
#
ita.100.t: "Britain agrees to sell Malta"
ita.100.d: "In a surprisingly sensible response from notoriously Perfidious Albion, Britain has agreed to sell us the island of Malta. While some say the Maltese are a unique ethno group most Italians are looking forward to the annexation of this territory, silly local dialects and all."
ita.100.a: "Finally a sensible response from Britain"
#
ita.101.t: "Britain refuses to sell Malta"
ita.101.d: "Despite the strength of our claims to the island of Malta, Britain has refused to sell this region to us. Malta's strategic location can not be forgotten. For the sake of our national security we may have to consider more drastic actions to subdue British influence on the island"
ita.101.a: "The tyranny of Perfidious Albion knows no bounds"
#
ita.102.t: "Italy demands guaranteed access though the Mediterranean"
ita.102.d: "For decades maritime access to the Mediterranean has been firmly within the control of Britain. Both the Suez Canal and Gibraltar are our possessions, the strategic control of which is vital for our Empire. This situation has put us at odds with nations that depend on these water ways for their shipping needs. This brings in the Italians who have sent us a list of territorial \"guarantees\". In the event that The United Kingdom is no longer able to protect the security of it's empire, the Italians want our blessing to secure Gibraltar and Suez for the purpose of guarantying naval access to Mediterranean. In Britain the vague wording of the Italian document has some ministers concerned about it's hypothetical enforcement but advocates for it see this agreement with Italy as a solid first step towards rapprochement. The value that these waterways have for our empire can not go unstated. If we truly do seek rapprochement with Italy we may want to consider sending a counter offer, granting them some lesser Mediterranean bases."
ita.102.a: "If this will stabilize our relationship with Italy we should accept"
ita.102.b: "We can never accept such an outrageous demand"
ita.102.c: "Maybe we can offer them other concessions"
#
ita.103.t: "Britain agrees to guarantee free access through the Mediterranean"
ita.103.d: "Knowing the value that the Suez Canal and Gibraltar have for much of Europe's shipping needs, Britain has given us their blessing to secure these regions if they can no longer protect it themselves."
ita.103.a: "A sensible choice really"
#
ita.104.t: "Britain refuses to make any guarantee"
ita.104.d: "Despite knowing the value that the Suez Canal and Gibraltar have for much of Europe's shipping needs, Britain has refused to give us their blessing to secure these regions in the event that they can no longer protect it themselves. If such an event were to happen we must have a plan to secure our shipping lanes no matter what London says."
ita.104.a: "We must not be pushed around by Britain"
#
ita.105.t: "Britain makes a counter offer"
ita.105.d: "It was obvious to most in Rome that London would never accept our offer as is. Gibraltar and the Suez Canal are just too important for the survival of their empire. What wasn't expected though is that they have instead offered us the immediate control over several bases within the Mediterranean itself. While some may argue that these concession doesn't solve the issue at hand, Italian maritime access in and out of the Mediterranean, the British offer would greatly expand our influence in the important region."
ita.105.a: "This deal is satisfactory"
ita.105.b: "This offer is nowhere near good enough"
#
ita.106.t: "Italy accepts our compromise"
ita.106.d: "The seemingly desperate Italians have agreed to our counter offer granting them naval bases in the Mediterranean. Hopefully this agreement will help improve relations between our two countries while maintaining our firm sovereignty over Suez and Gibraltar"
ita.106.a: "Good time doing business with them"
#
ita.107.t: "Italy refuses our compromise"
ita.107.d: "Unsurprisingly Italy has refused our counter offer which would have granted them our basses within the Mediterranean. Compared to the original Italian offer it was almost modest in it's contents. For the foreseeable future Anglo-Italian relations will remain cold to say the least."
ita.107.a: "Compromise is seemingly an unfamiliar term for the Italian"
#
ita.108.t: "Britain has fallen, It's time to secure the Mediterranean"
ita.108.d: "The world order as it has stood for centuries has been swept away in an instant. \"Pax Britannia\" has been shattered beyond repair leaving the future of Europe and possibly the entire world in doubt. With what's left of the British Empire clinging on to life it seems that it's time for us to enforce our agreement with the British and secure Gibraltar and the Suez Canal. The seemingly inevitable collapse of the British Empire will force the still standing powers of Europe to pick up the scraps and take her place as the protectors of Civilization."
ita.108.a: "It's our time to guarantee the stability of the Mediterranean"
#
ita.109.t: "Italy seeks to form an alliance with us"
ita.109.d: "The falling out between France and Italy has made both sides desperate for new allies to counter the growing German rearmament. As a fellow naval power Italy has come to us in the hopes of securing an alliance. Italy had been our ally previously in the Great War where they fought bravely against Austro-Hungarian forces but in the aftermath of the conflict the once united Entente fell apart with Britain choosing isolation leaving France and Italy to maintain peace on the continent alone. While many great empires have attempted this in the past, the task was seemingly too much for the Franco-Italian alliance. Rome now seeks an alliance with us. An Anglo-Italian alliance would be a major shake up to the balance of power. Our combined navies would easily overwhelm France or Germany plus our two nation's location within Europe would force either of those powers into a two front war if needed. While this all sounds good on paper, if there is anything we learned from the Great War is that Italian ambitions severely out weigh their competency. Many in Britain fear that an alliance with Italy will only serve to drag us down when we inevitably have to save them from military collapse."
ita.109.a: "An ally to counter French and German Influence on the continent would be beneficial"
ita.109.b: "Italy would be more of a liability than an asset"
#
ita.110.t: "Britain agrees to an alliance"
ita.110.d: "Realizing our naval prowess and strategic location in Europe, the British have agreed to an alliance. Together our two empires possess the largest combined naval forces the world has ever seen and our land armies are only matched by a select few nations."
ita.110.a: "Together we will encircle both France and Germany"
#
ita.111.t: "Britain refuses to form an alliance with us"
ita.111.d: "Despite our naval prowess and strategic location in Europe, the British have refused to from an alliance. We must act soon if we are to protect ourselves from the groing aggression of France and Germany."
ita.111.a: "Italy must clearly form her own destiny"
#
ita.112.t: "Italy denounces our nation"
ita.112.d: "Tensions between [GetName.SER] and Italy have been high since the conclusion of the Great War. Border disputes between our two nations have been a serious sore spot in Serbian-Italian relations. When The State of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs joined The Kingdom of Serbia to form the Pan-Slavic state of \"Yugoslavia\" Italy pressured the victorious Entente powers to prohibit this union, fearing that it's pan-ethnic values would weaken Italian claims in Croatia. In a compromise between the two sides Serbia was granted these former Austrian lands but could not form a de jure Pan-Slavic state. This decision though did little to appease either side as it did not do much to address conflicting land claims. Today though Rome has denounced [GetName.SER] as a authoritarian back water that cares little of it's ethnic minorities. While no territorial claims were pushed forward by Rome it's clear this action was intended to hurt the legitimacy of Belgrade and to provoke conflict. If Italy is dead set on creating more tension between our two states we may want to ask France for support."
ita.112.a: "Italy is a violent nation"
ita.112.b: "Maybe we should seek support from France"
#
ita.113.t: "Serbia requests support to counter Italian aggression"
ita.113.d: "Italy has recently come out denouncing the legitimacy of [GetName.SER]. This action threatens the stability of the entire Balkans and may escalate to open conflict. The obviously concerned Serbians have come to us seeking military support to deter any further Italian aggression. While we are obligated to protect the sovereignty of Entente Council members, provoking hostilities with out neighbor Italy may do more harm than good."
ita.113.a: "Italian aggression can't stand unopposed"
ita.113.b: "We have bigger priorities than these two"
#
ita.114.t: "France sends supplies"
ita.114.d: "Hearing our pleas the French have agreed to send us supplies. It seems France is serious about maintaining the stability of Europe."
ita.114.a: "This will teach the Italians"
#
ita.115.t: "France refuses to send supplies"
ita.115.d: "Despite hearing our desperate pleas the French have refused to send us supplies. It seems the French are not serious about maintaining the stability of Europe."
ita.115.a: "Damn them"
#
ita.116.t: "Which organization to support?"
ita.116.d: "[GetName.SER] is a diverse and unequal state. With the collapse of the Austro-Hungarian Empire many ethnic minorities within the Balkans were pressured to form a union with Serbia and live under Belgrade's thumb. While the world may ignore their pleas for independence it's clear that the time has come to support these separatist movements. The Croatian Ustashe lead by Ante Pavelić seeks for the independence of Croatia and Bosnia by any means necessary. They have committed several terrorist attacks throughout [GetName.SER] and are highly organized but lack supply and proper training. While they seem like a good choice to covertly help us undermine the stability [GetName.SER] the Ustashe have made claims to our territories on the Adriatic in the past. The last thing we would want is an organized terror group within Italy. Alternatively we could support the Macedonian \"Internal Macedonian Revolutionary Organization\" or IMRO. This organization has existed since 1893 and has over the course of it's life supported both the independence of Macedonia and union with Bulgaria. In the past they have killed several high ranking politicians in Bulgaria and Yugoslavia but do to their decentralized nature have neen very quiet for the last few years. Unlike the Ustashe, we have no border disputes with the IMRO and could fairly easily train their agents for future terrorist action."
ita.116.a: "Support the Croatian Ustashe"
ita.116.b: "Support Macedonian IMRO"
ita.116.c: "Support Both"
#
ita.117.t: "Terror groups on the Rise"
ita.117.d: "Several separatist groups have been active throughout [GetName.SER] history but until recently they were very minor forces. Seemingly out of nowhere though several attacks have taken place throughout the country that have police shocked. The exact details of who are behind them are currently unknown but local authorities have already begun to investigate."
ita.117.a: "We must crack down on them"
#
ita.118.t: "Italy caught supporting local terrorists"
ita.118.d: "The rapid increase in terrorist action within our country was clearly not a natural increase but until recently there was no obvious cause. Serbian investigators though have found several Italian weapons and correspondence with Rome in the possession of terrorist suspects which pretty much unquestionable points to Italy as the catalyst of this recent unrest. Of course Rome denies this allegation."
ita.118.a: "Italy will pay for this"
#
ita.119.t: "Serbia cracks down on terror groups"
ita.119.d: "Over the course of several anti-terrorists police operations, [GetName.SER] has successfully cracked down on domestic terror groups. Whatever is left of these groups lies scattered and unorganized, unable to cause any real damage to the state."
ita.119.a: "Finally our nation will return to normal"
ita.119.b: "We should have striked sooner"
#
ita.120.t: "Croatian nationalists join our crusade"
ita.120.d: "The Ustashe lead by Ante Pavelić has taken advantage of our war against [GetName.SER] and has staged an open revolt within Croatia. Hopefully this helps strengthen our position as liberators against Serbian dominance as opposed to simple conquerors"
ita.120.a: "together we will end the tyranny of Serbia"

ita.121.t: "Macedonian nationalists join our crusade"

#
ita.124.t: "Italy requests an alliance with us"
ita.124.d: "The Treaty of Neuilly-sur-Seine was devastating for Bulgaria who lost nearly all the land they had gained in the previous Balkan wars to their neighbors. Italy who has also grown dissatisfied with the results of the Great War has come to us to discuss the possibility of an alliance. It's clear that we share many of the same ambitions against Serbia and Greece. If Italy is destined to go to war with these two we would be foolish not to be included in those peace conferences. Our nation is isolated from Italy though. If any conflict with our neighbors isn't settled quickly it may be impossible to get direct military support from Rome. We must make our decision wisely as the ramifications of this alliance will be massive for our tiny state."

ita.127.t: "Italy seeks to revise Balkan treaties"
ita.127.d: "Rome has announced today their intentions of revising the Treaty of Versailles and several other treaties that they claim have \"absolutely devastated\" the Balkan Peninsula. While no specific goals or plans were made by Italy it's clear that this announcement was targeted at nations like Serbia and Romania who both gained the most territory from their neighbors following the Great War. In any case this action from Italy only serves to destabilize the region and provoke conflict."
ita.127.a: "How dare they threaten us like this"
ita.127.b: "Quite interesting indeed"
#
ita.128.t: "Italy requests an alliance with us"
ita.128.d: "The Treaty of Trianon was absolutely devastating for Hungary who lost 70% of the land that made up the Millennium old Kingdom of Hungary. Italy who has also grown dissatisfied with the results of the Great War has come to us to discuss the possibility of an alliance. It's clear that we share many of the same ambitions against Serbia and Romania. If Italy is destined to go to war with these two we would be foolish not to be included in those peace conferences.

[ITA.GetLeader] has made clear that Italy and [ITA.GetFactionName]\"Shall respond with swift and decisive action\" if the ultimatum is not agreed to in a timely manner.

Following the end of the Great War Romania was granted an immense amount of land from her neighbors, a situation that still causes international tension to this day. Italy has seemingly taken the initiative to reverse these territorial annexations by demanding that Romania return this land or face a possible invasion. As one of the largest nations in the Balkans, the dismantling of Romania could irreversibly destabilize the peninsula and would give Italy and her allies guaranteed access to Romania's massive oil reserves which may shift the European balance of power."

As our allies and the international community as a whole look down upon us in this defining hour few in Rome can bear the thought of simply backing down but the reality of the situation can not be ignored. Most of Italy's commanders do not believe our nation is ready for another major war quite yet but if we were to quickly secure the Romanian oil fields Italy would be in a much better position to fight."

ita.144.d: "As fellow Southern European nations with a strong maritime tradition both Greece and Italy share many of the same strategic and political goals. Greece was our ally in the Great War and assisted us in subduing the Turkish National Movement rebellion that nearly forced us out of Anatolia. Since then though our two expanding nations have come into conflict. Disputed territories in Albania and Anatolia have began to sour relations between out two countries and little has been done to correct this.

Rome has now sent us an ultimatum demanding \n\n1.) The demilitarization of the Greco-Albanian border\n2.) The surrender of Crete and the Aegean Islands to Italian occupation\n3.) Free access to our country for the Italian Military\n\nIt's clear that these demands are only a pretext to allow Italy to invade and occupy our country.

Both Italy and Greece have disputed each other's shared borders in the past which seems to have culminated in a border clash between each other's armies in southern Albania.

ita.153.d: "Despite our efforts to isolate and surround them, Greece has somehow gotten the support of the French who now demand for us cease all aggression towards the Greeks. As our allies and the international community as a whole look down upon us in this defining hour few in Rome can bear the thought of simply backing down but the reality of the situation can not be ignored. Most of Italy's commanders do not believe our nation is ready for another major war quite yet but if we were to quickly subdue Greece, Italy would be in a much better position to fight."
ita.153.a: "Italy's destiny can not be stopped"
ita.153.b: "We are in no position to fight a major war"
#
ita.154.t: "Italy agrees to stand down"
ita.154.d: "After an emergency meeting between French and Italian diplomats, Rome has bent to French pressure and has agreed to stand down and to avoid further hostilities towards Greece. Despite the apparent stalemate both sides claim victory. [ITA.GetLeader] declared \"Italy has now truly become a Great Power able to apply decisive pressure the nations of Europe as she wishes\" while in France this is seen as another example of the Entente Council's ability to reach peaceful conclusions to European disputes."
ita.154.a: "Sometimes the pen is mightier than the sword"
#
ita.155.t: "France refuses to directly involved"
ita.155.d: "Despite being the self appointed protector of European stability the French have refused to take sides against Italy's blatant aggression."
ita.155.a: "Damn those traitors"
#
ita.156.t: "Greece has been attacked!"
ita.156.d: "Despite our efforts to pressure the Italians to stand down it seems Rome has continued towards their suicidal path and has invaded Greece. As our agreement with the Greeks states, we are now obligated to give them full military support against Italian aggression. For the fist time in nearly 2 decades the Great Powers are once again on the brink of war. The decision we make now will have major ramifications for decades to come."
ita.156.a: "We will support their cause"
ita.156.b: "We are in no position to intervene"
#
ita.157.t: "France refuses to defend us"
ita.157.d: "Despite the agreement they signed with us pledging their direct support in the event of an Italian lead invasion, France has refused to fulfill their end of the bargain."
ita.157.a: "Damn them!"
#
ita.160.t: "Italy offers us an alliance"
ita.160.d: "While Italian-Greek relations have been poor for the last couple decades, it seems Italy wishes to put any animosity in the past and has offered us an alliance. While some ministers are open to this offer as it would provide us protection from the hostile Turks and Serbs those who oppose the Italians protest any alliance as long as our territorial disputes go unsettled. This might be a good opportunity to finally end these disputes."
ita.160.a: "We must accept"
ita.160.b: "Never"
ita.160.c: "Only if they agree to settle territorial disputes"
#
ita.161.t: "Greece agrees to an alliance"
ita.161.d: "As a fellow naval power within the Mediterranean it's obvious we share many of the same international goals and as such the Greeks have agreed to an alliance."
ita.161.a: "A toast to our Greek friends"
#
ita.162.t: "Greece refuses our offer of an alliance"
ita.162.d: "Despite being a fellow naval power within the Mediterranean with many of the same international goals, The Greeks have refused our offer of an alliance."
ita.162.a: "Damn"
#
ita.163.t: "Greece requests the return of core territory for an alliance"
ita.163.d: "A major roadblock in Greco-Italian relations have been our conflicting territorial claims. The utter chaos of the Great War lead to both sides occupying land that had been historically part of each others Sphere of Influence. Athens has informed us that they would be interested in an alliance with us only if we agree to transfer core Greek territory back to their sole control."
ita.163.a: "We can accept those terms"
ita.163.b: "The Greeks are a waste of time"
#
ita.164.t: "Italy agrees to return our territory"
ita.164.d: "It seems the Italians are truly interested in burying the hatchet between our two nations. They have agreed return disputed territory back to our control, bringing forth a bright new era in Greco-Italian relations."
ita.164.a: "Good on them"
#
ita.165.t: "Italy refuses to return our territory"
ita.165.d: "It seems the Italian offer of an alliance with us was not made in good faith. As soon as we seek compromise with Rome they refuse to even consider it. Despite what Italy may say it's clear they do not view our nation as an equal."
ita.165.a: "Damn them"
#
ita.166.t: "Italy delivers an ultimatum"
ita.166.d: "Our nation's recent remilitarization has not gone unnoticed by the Great Powers of Europe. Italy, who has been expanding their influence into the Balkans, has sent us an ultimatum demanding\n\n1.)The Demilitarization of [341.GetName] and [347.GetName]\n\n2.)The immediate termination of our country's remilitarization\n\nIt's clear that these demands are only a pretext to allow Italy to undermine our sovereignty. We must not allow the European powers continue to subjugate our great nation."
ita.166.a: "Ignore the Italian \"Threat\""
ita.166.b: "We are not ready to provoke a war"
#
ita.167.t: "Turkey has ignored our ultimatum"
ita.167.d: "Despite the fact that we surround their insignificant rump state the Turks have refused to end their remilitarization efforts. If we are to secure our holdings in Anatolia we must do so by force."
ita.167.a: "We can not let this stand"
#
ita.168.t: "Turkey has accepted our demands"
ita.168.d: "It was obvious to most that the Turks would not dare stand against our demands. We surround their insignificant nation and could easily decimate it if needed but sometimes the pen is mightier than the sword. The Turks have agreed to our ultimatum without the need for bloodshed. It seems for now our holdings in Anatolia will be secure for the foreseeable future."
ita.168.a: "A wise decision"
#
ita.170.t: "Italy proclaims the annexation of Albania"
ita.170.d: "Ever since the conclusion of the Great War Albania has been effectively a puppet of Italy. Italian officials in the country have pursued and policy of Italianization, forcing the Italian language and culture on our citizens while suppressing local efforts to grow Albanian national identity. Today this has come to it's logical conclusion as Rome has announced the annexation of our country as the newest Region of Italy. While some within the country are looking forward to the benefits of becoming full Italian citizens, most Albanians are enraged over the fact that once again our nation is being subjugated by our larger neighbors. Albanians fought bravely to secure our independence from the Ottomans, Serbs and Austrians. To once again become just another foot note within the history books would be an insult to their sacrifices."
ita.170.a: "We are in no position to oppose"
ita.170.b: "Albanians shall never stand for this!"
#
ita.171.t: "Albania rejects annexation"
ita.171.d: "Italian influence in Albania was never popular with the local population. The choice to annex the region was seen as short sighted by many who suspected that Albanians would reject such a bold decree. Now the Albanian government, possibly influenced by the growing anti-Italian movement, has rejected annexation. If we are to integrate this region into Italy we will have to do it by force."
ita.171.a: "Albanians will appreciate Italy's greatness soon enough"
#
ita.172.t: "Italy seeks ties with local socialist groups"
ita.172.d: "The recent revolution in Italy has seemingly emboldened the government in Rome who now seek to form ties with fellow socialist movements within our country. Little has come of this yet but we must not let our enemies undermine our nation and political legitimacy."
ita.172.a: "We must keep an eye on this"
#
ita.173.t: "Italy wishes to improve relations"
ita.173.d: "The recent revolution in Italy has brought a socialist government into power in Rome. Being surrounded by reactionary forces, Italy seeks the international support of fellow socialist comrades such as our self. An Italian diplomatic massion has arrived in our nation to help foster positive relations. How shall we respond to this?"
ita.173.a: "Cheers to our Italian Comrades"
ita.173.b: "We would rather not associate with Rome"
#
ita.174.t: "Italy offers us an alliance"
ita.174.d: "It seems Revolution has been spreading across the Mediterranean. Italy has recently come under the control of a socialist government much like our own and as such our two nations share many of the same strategic and political goals. Realizing this the Italians have offered us an alliance. As the reactionary forces of Germany and France grow in power it may be in our best interests to secure an ally of our own."
ita.174.a: "A cheer to our Italian Comrades"

#
ita.176.t: "[From.GetName] refuses an alliance"
ita.176.d: "Despite the fact that both our nations share many of the same strategic and political goals, [From.GetName] has refused to form an alliance with us. They naively believe that neutrality will keep their nation safe."
ita.176.a: "Let the reactionary forces of the world dismantle their Revolution"
#
ita.177.t: "Italy request admission into the [SOV.GetFactionName]"
ita.177.d: "Italy has been the home of many revolutionary movements for decades now. When the Great War concluded for Italy it seemed that the wounded state would surely follow in the foot steps of Russia and be the next country to become embroiled in a popular socialist uprising but political infighting between that nation's socialist factions killed any chance of this, or so many thought. The recent Italian election gave the [ITA.GetRulingParty] enough legislative influence needed to support a popular socialist movement which has helped cement leftist control over the country. This has concerned Italy's reactionary neighbors who will look for any excuse to undo the liberation of the working class, as such Italy is looking for powerful allies like ourselves to protect their Revolution. The USSR has been isolated from Western Europe since it's inception and has missed out on the intellectual and monetary capital that the west has a near monopoly over. An alliance with Italy would give us access to their scientific and naval experts while also helping legitimize both of our revolutionary governments. Opponents to an Italian alliance though worry that our two nations are too isolated from one another to effectively cooperate as allies in any meaningful way."
ita.177.a: "We will accept our Italian Comrades"
ita.177.b: "We have internal issues to deal with first"
#
ita.178.t: "[From.GetName] accepts us into the [SOV.GetFactionName]"
ita.178.d: "Realizing that both our nations share many of the same strategic and political goals, [From.GetName] has agreed to form an alliance with us. Italy now makes the 2nd Great Power to be part of the [SOV.GetFactionName]. Together we will protect our people from the reactionary forces of Europe."
ita.178.a: "A cheer to our Soviet Comrades"
#
ita.179.t: "[From.GetName] refuses admission into the [SOV.GetFactionName]"
ita.179.d: "Despite the fact that both our nations share many of the same strategic and political goals, [From.GetName] has refused to form an alliance with us. They claim that internal conflicts are too dire to waste an resources abroad."
ita.179.a: "Let the reactionary forces of the world dismantle their Revolution"
#
ita.180.t: "Italy offers us an alliance"
ita.180.d: "It seems bold leadership has been spreading across the Mediterranean. Italy has recently come under the control of a [ITA.GetRulingIdeology] government much like our own and as such our two nations share many of the same strategic and political goals. Realizing this the Italians have offered us an alliance. As the enemies of southern europeans, Germany and France, grow in power it may be in our best interests to secure an ally of our own."
ita.180.a: "A cheer to our Italian allies"

ita.182.a: "Let the great powers of the world trample their useless nation"
#
ita.183.t: "[From.GetName] requests control over [177.GetName]"
ita.183.d: "Italy as a naval power requires certain strategic bases to fully be able to exert it's maritime influence. With the decimation of the Spanish fleet following our Civil War, The British are now the undisputed power in the Western Mediterranean and their base at Gibraltar remains secure. The Italians wish to counter this but they have no base within range to attack Gibraltar if needed and as such they request control of [177.GetName] as a staging ground for their Navy and Air Force. If we are to ever receive the support needed recover Gibraltar we might have to accept Italy's demand."
ita.183.a: "We can allow this for now"
ita.183.b: "We will not bend to Italy's every demand"
#
ita.184.t: "[From.GetName] agrees to hand over [177.GetName]"
ita.184.d: "Seeing the strategic value of the Italian Navy, [From.GetName] has agreed to transfer control of [177.GetName] to our country. With this western base our two nations will be able to easily tackle the British in Gibraltar if such a need arises."
ita.184.a: "A wise choice"
#
ita.185.t: "[From.GetName] refuses to hand over [177.GetName]"
ita.185.d: "Despite the fact that both our states seek to expel the foreign influence of Britain from the Mediterranean, [From.GetName] has refused to hand over control of [177.GetName]. We will now be forced to tackle our enemies from bases situated far away within Italy itself."
ita.185.a: "Damn them"
#
ita.186.t: "Who shall we offer the lease of [768.GetName] to?"
ita.186.d: "Italy holds a very enviable strategic position in the central Mediterranean. From Italian bases our navy can strike nearly anywhere within the Mediterranean, a fact that many of our neighbors are well aware of. To help raise funds for the state some liberal Italian ministers have suggested that we could lease some of our naval bases a foreign power. [768.GetName] is a good candidate for this since it lies within squarely within the Western Mediterranean, a dense shipping region. While leasing this port would help generate much needed funds it has yet to be decided to whom we would offer this lease too. Many Great Powers would surely be more than happy to take us up on this offer."
ita.186.a: "Let's offer the lease to [ENG.GetName]"
ita.186.b: "Let's offer the lease to [SOV.GetName]"
ita.186.c: "Let's offer the lease to [GER.GetName]"
ita.186.e: "Let's offer the lease to [USA.GetName]"
ita.186.f: "Perhaps we should reconsider this plan"
#
ita.187.t: "Italy offers to lease [768.GetName] to us"
ita.187.d: "Italy seemingly desperate for funds has offered us a lease over [768.GetName]. While it's strategic location within the Western Mediterranean does make it a valuable base many within our country are suspicious of working with the Italians and are doubtful that the cost of the lease is worth the strategic value it may grant our nation."
ita.187.a: "It would make for a good base"
ita.187.b: "We are not interested"
#
ita.188.t: "[From.GetName] agrees to lease [768.GetName]"
ita.188.d: "Realizing it's massive strategic value, [From.GetName] has agreed to lease [768.GetName] from us."
ita.188.a: "A pleasure doing business with you"

ita.189.t: "[From.GetName] declines to lease [768.GetName]"
ita.189.d: "Despite it's massive strategic value, [From.GetName] has declined to lease [768.GetName] from us."
ita.189.a: "Perhaps we should find another buyer"
ita.189.b: "It was profitable while it lasted"
#
ita.190.t: "Shall we extend the lease of [768.GetName]?"
ita.190.d: "The lease agreement for [768.GetName] has almost come to an end. While it brought in much needed funds for Italy it may be time to reassume direct ownership of this strategic port, especially as our enemies continue to grow in strength and threaten our sovereignty."
ita.190.a: "Let's extend the lease"
ita.190.b: "It's time to reassume ownership"
#
ita.191.t: "Italy offers to extend the lease of [768.GetName]"
ita.191.d: "It seems the Italians were highly satisfied with our arrangement regarding [768.GetName] and wish to extend the lease. Now having the direct experience and knowledge of managing a Mediterranean base we are in a more well informed position to decide if this lease is worth the cost."
ita.191.a: "We will continue our lease"
ita.191.b: "We are no longer interested in this agreement"
#
ita.192.t: "Italy no longer wishes to lease [768.GetName]"
ita.192.d: "With the economic situation improving in Italy, Rome no longer sees the need to lease [768.GetName] to generate funds and as such they have chosen not to renew our lease. [768.GetName] will now return to direct Italian control."
ita.192.a: "It was fun while it lasted"
#
ita.193.t: "Italy leaves the Entente"
ita.193.d: "Relations between France and Italy have slowly deteriorated ever since the end of the Great War. Territorial disputes with her neighbors brought Italy into the Entente 20 years ago and now it seems this imperialistic attitude has torn apart whats left of this once mighty alliance. As one of the youngest Great Powers Italy was never held in the same regard as France or Britain by most of the international community. Italy's desperation to become the dominating power within the Mediterranean had put her at odds with France in the past but many had hoped that their alliance would put an end to these squabbles but it seems the ambition of a growing Empire can never truly go away. Italy has now chosen to seek their own destiny separate from France. This development has put the fate of the Entente in question. Will France's Pan-European organization survive without one of it's most powerful members? Will Germany become emboldened by this and increase the speed of their re-armament? The future of Europe as we know it may be slowly reaching it's end."
ita.193.a: "Damn those Italians!"
#
ita.194.t: "Which region to host our military exercise with France"
ita.194.d: "With the growing threat of German re-armament it's paramount that we make sure France's and our armies are still capable of defending against any possible German offensive. Germany has once again made sure to acquire allies and as such we will need to make sure our armies our flexible and able to tackle many possible scenarios. The most obvious region the Germans may attack is the Rhine. The French occupation of this region has been a sore spot in Franco-German relations and [GER.GetLeader] has made no secret of his desire to reclaim it. The Rhine river offers much protection but it is by no means uncrossable. Austria is also a region of German ambition. If they were to annex this region it would be a seriously blow to Italian security. We must not allow the Germans to flank our armies through the Alps. While the German navy is small it is rapidly growing. German submarines make many practice voyages in North Sea. We must make sure we can counter these if war breaks out. While Germany has little influence in the Mediterranean we must also stay vigilante here as well/"
ita.194.a: "We shall set our exercise in the the Rhine"
ita.194.b: "We shall set our exercise in the the Alps"
ita.194.c: "We shall set our exercise in the the North Sea"
ita.194.e: "We shall set our exercise in the the Mediterranean"
#
ita.195.t: "Italy suggests a military exercise on the Rhine"
ita.195.d: "As German forces increase in number on the Rhenish border, Italy has suggested we start an military exercise in the region to keep our army in top shape in the event of a German invasion."
ita.195.a: "A smart choice"
#
ita.196.t: "Italy suggests a military exercise in the Alps"
ita.196.d: "As Germany increases it's influence in Austria, Italy has suggested we start an military exercise in the region to keep our army in top shape in the event of a German invasion."
ita.196.a: "A smart choice"
#
ita.197.t: "Italy suggests a military exercise in the North Sea"
ita.197.d: "As Germany increases the size of it's Navy, Italy has suggested we start an military exercise in the North Sea to keep our Navy in top shape in the event of war with Germany."
ita.197.a: "A smart choice"
#
ita.198.t: "Italy suggests a military exercise in the Mediterranean"
ita.198.d: "As Germany increases it's influence in the Mediterranean, Italy has suggested we start an military exercise in the region to keep our Navy in top shape in the event of war with Germany."
ita.198.a: "A smart choice"
#
ita.199.t: "Learning from the Rhine exercise"
ita.199.d: "The Rhine makes up the Entente's largest border with Germany. It's obvious that most of Berlin's focus will be on that region if war breaks out. While the Rhine river does offer protection our exercise has shown that the Rhine valley is vulnerable to rapid advancements if the German's manage to make it across. We must prepare for this."
ita.199.a: "Interesting"
#
ita.200.t: "Learning from the Alpine exercise"
ita.200.d: "The Alps give Italy a natural defense against a possible German invasion but it's only been a couple decades since Austro-German forces once nearly managed to capture Venice. We must not again underestimate the German army like that. Our recent exercise has shown that we must update infrastructure and fortifications in the region if we wish to defend it from the German menace"
ita.200.a: "Interesting"
#
ita.201.t: "Learning from the North Sea exercise"
ita.201.d: "The growing German Kriegsmarine is starting to become a threat to the French Navy in the North Sea. Our exercise has shown that a Combined Dutch and German fleet may be able to overwhelm France's local fleet. To defeat Germany in a future we must support our ships in the region and keep Germany blockaded."
ita.201.a: "Interesting"
#
ita.202.t: "Learning from the Mediterranean exercise"
ita.202.d: "While Germany has very little direct influence in the Mediterranean they have increased efforts to find allies in the region. While the Italian fleet is the largest in the Mediterranean, our exercise has hinted that the opening of another front may spread the Italian navy too thin which Germany will surely take advantage if war breaks out."
ita.202.a: "Interesting"
#
ita.203.t: "Italians send us an ultimatum"
ita.203.d: "For months now Italy has been supporting terrorist elements within our country that seek to tear our great nation apart. Under the guise of \"Liberators\" Rome has sent us an ultimatum demanding that we release these rebellious regions. It's clear that Italy does not care about about the right to self determination as they state to the public but are only interested in dismantling Serbia and expanding their own influence into the Balkans. Our army is prepared to defend our territory at all cost but it's clear to most the the Italian army is better equipped and trained. We may want to seek the support of France in mediating this conflict."
ita.203.a: "We must avoid bloodshed"
ita.203.b: "If they want our land they must come and take it"
ita.203.c: "Let's petition France for support"
#
ita.204.t: "Serbia refuses our demands"
ita.204.d: "Despite the continued pressure from our guerrilla allies within Serbia, it seems Belgrade has no interest granting them the independence they deserve. A rogue nation like Serbia can no longer be allowed to oppress their own people without being challenged. The Italian army must march into their backwards country and liberate their people by force."
ita.204.a: "The wrongs of Versailles shall be corrected"
ita.204.b: "We can't risk war with France"
#
ita.205.t: "Serbia request support against Italy"
ita.205.d: "Serbia has recently come under the crosshairs of Italy and has requested our support to secure their sovereignty. Even before the Great War Serbia had been expanding in the Balkans at the expense of the Ottomans and the Bulgarians, a situation that still causes same international tension to this day. The Great War only exacerbated these territorial disputes when Serbia was granted most of the Slavic lands held by Austria-Hungary. Italy has seemingly taken the initiative to reverse these territorial annexations by demanding that Serbia return much of this land or face a possible invasion. As one of the largest nations in the Balkans, the dismantling of Serbia could irreversibly destabilize the peninsula and would cement Italy as the unquestioned authority over the region."
ita.205.a: "We shall protect Serbia from tyranny"
ita.205.b: "We can't risk war with Italy"
#
ita.206.t: "France agrees to support us against Italy"

ita.208.d: "After an emergency meeting between French and Italian diplomats, Rome has bent to French pressure and has agreed to stand down and to avoid further hostilities towards Greece. Despite the apparent stalemate both sides claim victory. [ITA.GetLeader] declared \"Italy has now truly become a Great Power able to apply decisive pressure the nations of Europe as she wishes\" while in France this is seen as another example of the Entente Council's ability to reach peaceful conclusions to European disputes."

ita.209.a: "Damn them too!"

ita.210.t: "Serbia has been attacked!"
ita.210.d: "Despite our efforts to pressure the Italians to stand down it seems Rome has continued towards their suicidal path and has invaded Serbia. As our agreement with the Serbians states, we are now obligated to give them full military support against Italian aggression. For the fist time in nearly 2 decades the Great Powers are once again on the brink of war. The decision we make now will have major ramifications for decades to come."

ita.212.t: "Italy demands we return Albanian land"
ita.212.d: "Albania, being at the crossroads of many powerful nations has had a tumultuous history. They gained their independence from the Ottoman Empire following the First Balkan War only to be subjugated once again by their neighbors in the conclusion of the Great War. Italy, despite taking part in Albania's subjugation, is apparently very concerned with their territorial integrity. Rome demands that we return our Albanian land to them. This is an obvious ploy from Italy to dismantle our own nation and allow them to spread their influence in the Balkans. We must do all we can to defend our nation from these foreign threats."
ita.212.a: "We must avoid bloodshed"

ita.213.t: "Italy demands we return Hungarian land"
ita.213.d: "The Great War lead to the dismantling of the Austro-Hungarian Empire including the decimation of the Kingdom of Hungary itself. For our participation in the war effort the Entente granted us land that had been previously part of the Hungarian realm. Italy is clearly taking advantage of this minor border dispute to gain more influence over our nation. We should never back down to threats like this. Surely the Entente Council will back us in this crisis."

ita.214.d: "Bulgaria has been an enemy of Serbia ever since the 2nd Balkan War. After that conflict and the Great War we were awarded Bulgarian land for our participation in the Entente victory against the Central Powers. Italy is clearly taking advantage of this minor border dispute to gain more influence over our nation. We should never back down to threats like this. Surely the Entente Council will back us in this crisis."

The growing threat of Germany has forced France to focus their efforts in protecting the Rhine leaving the French Alps only lightly defended.

On one hand the Greece was our ally in the Great War but the nation now has become overextended and may even soon become a threat to us. On the other hand The Ottoman Empire, despite being our enemy in the war, will surely want this land back for it is mostly inhabited by ethnic Turks and would provide access to the Mediterranean."

ita.230.t: "How should we reform the army?"
ita.230.d: "The “Regio Esercito Italiano” has been the National Army since the foundation of the kingdom and it has taken part in all the Italian conflicts. During the Great War 5 million soldiers were part of the army, but the number has decreased since then and the new tactics we have learned during the war could help modernize our army. The spirit of the Duke of Victory Armando Diaz, whom passed away in 1928, is still living strong in the army and thanks to him Italian soldiers are no longer under equipped but this has also lead to complacency within the commanding officers which may weaken are ability to defend ourselves. Earlier attempts at modernization began when Italy started purchasing tanks from Britain in 1928 which has helped the Italian war industry advance quite significantly. FIAT is pushing for the implementation of newer, home built, tanks into the army so we can spare our soldiers the unprotected slaughter they were subjected to in the Great War but some officers believe that the one major reason for the Italian army's poor performance in that war was due to the lack of sufficient artillery. Instead of focusing on expensive and vulnerable tanks they think we should make sure our soldiers have advanced and powerful artillery to support their attacks. In Rome, collectivist politicians have influenced some army leaders to integrate the paramilitary/partisan Red Brigades into the army and push for the implementation of mass conscription and partisan warfare while the more conservative elements of parliament wish to give more autonomy to officers and generals who wish to create a strong, well trained and well equipped professional army spearheaded by powerful “Alpini” mountaineer divisions who are a great source of pride for the Italian Nation."

itafla.1.t: "The Death of Giuseppe Sergi"
itafla.1.d: "Famed Italian anthropologist Giuseppe Sergi passed away today at the age of 95. For decades he taught at both the University of Bologna and University of Rome La Sapienza where his dedication to his field helped popularize and develop anthropology into the modern science we know today. In recent years there has been a resurgence of interest in his works especially on the 'Mediterranean race'. As the German Reich continues to push propaganda on the superiority of the Nordic people many Italian nationalists have countered with their own theories of a unified Mediterranean race which can trace it's origins back to Rome, Europe's first great civilization. The far right Fasci Italiani del Sindacalismo Nazionale (FISN) party sees Sergi's writings as a cornerstone of their movement. As the Nordic nations of Britain and Germany continue to spread their influence into the Mediterranean the FISN will continue to promote their ideals of a united state in southern Europe built on the legacy of Rome that can combat these foreign invaders. Whether he is remembered as a nationalist hero or a promoter of the sciences, Giuseppe Sergi will go down as one Italy's most significant intellectuals."

Two factions exist within the leftist coalition, the pro-Moscow Communists lead by Amadeo Bordiga, Antonio Gramsci and Palmiro Togliatti and the reformist minded Socialists lead by Pietro Nenni and Giacomo Matteotti. The Communists, especially Togliatti, advocate for radical and immediate societal changes for Italy in the vein of The USSR, calling for the expulsion of the Royalty and the rapid collectivization of industry. The Socialists, fearing possible violent opposition and the collapse of Italy's vital alliance with France, instead support incremental reforms and compromises with Italy's existing power structures. To many on the far left Pietro Nenni and his fellow socialists are seen a traitors to the Revolution, Nenni himself even supported Italy's imperialistic entry into the Great War and even enlisted into the army. The moderate socialists though see the the communists as too idealistic and not pragmatic enough to turn their theories into praxis and would rather avoid needless bloodshed."

Now it seems the situation has hit a boiling point as the radical communist party have declared the creation of the \"Socialist Republic of Italy\" and have expelled much of Italy's former upper class including King Victor Emmanuel. For the time being Victor Emmanuel and his family are safe in France but we can not let this disregard of the democratic process go unpunished.

As the leader of the ruling FISN party and the National Syndicalist movement as a whole his death has sent a shock wave throughout Italy and the greater European community. His leadership and powerful oratory skills were paramount in bringing the FISN to power and revolutionizing Italian society. Preparations are being made for his funeral in which his coffin will be wrapped in flag of the Timavo and buried in the impressive mausoleum of the Vittoriale, a fitting resting place for such a national hero.\n\nDespite the national mourning we must continue to look towards the future of the party. Both houses of parliament have convened for an emergency meeting of the Arengo del Italia to decide on whom will succeed D'Annunzio as Comandante of Italy. As important as D'Annunzio has been for the party his leadership was far from perfect. He was never interested in the minute details of running a party let alone an entire nation state, choosing instead to focus on his writing and philosophy. This has forced many within the upper echelon of FISN to handle the duties usually expected of a Head of State. Though it isn't publicly known many of his close associates suspect that D'Annunzio's drug habit may have been exacerbated by the stress of his new position and may be responsible for his sudden death.\n\nWith D'Annunzio's death a power vacuum has opened within Italy that many within the FISN are desperately trying to fill. It will be some time before a new Comandante who can truly succeed D'Annunzio will be found. In the mean time we must remember this Italian hero and all the good that National Syndicalism has brought to Italy."

Three possible candidates have been found that are believed to be qualified enough to fill D'Annunzio's shoes.\n\nAlceste De Ambris, revolutionary syndicalist and coauthor of the Charter of Carnaro, is an obvious candidate for Comandante. Second only to D'annunzio himself, Ambris' political theories are a cornerstone of the National Syndicalist movement. Despite this many of his opponents are critical of his socialist past and his suspected relations with the USSR.\n\nEdmondo Rossoni, Secretary of The Confederation of Fascist Syndicates, is another possible candidate. A staunch ally of labor he is beloved by most of the working class as well as Italy's trade unions. He is a powerful and ambitious man with many grand plans for Italy but his hostility towards industrialists and other members of Italy's upper classes has lead to him being labeled as a \"Radical\" by some of the FISN more conservative elements who wish to see class cooperation.\n\nTullio Cianetti, radical trade unionist, has been selected as the final candidate. Despite his young age compared to most of the FISN leadership his reformist minded politics may bring new life to the party. He is already seen as a trusted ally of Italian labor but unlike Rossoni he shows no hostilities towards Italy's upper classes. His opponents though are concerned about his connections to Germany, specifically his friendship with Otto Strasser who's economic theories are seen with much skepticism back in Italy."

ARMY_RODOLFO_GRAZIANI_DESC: "§GMilitary Dossier\n§GBorn:§W11 August 1882 Filettino, Italy\n§GMilitary Career:§WGraziani joined the Regio Esercito (Royal Army) in 1903 and was soon stationed in Italian Eritrea. His first taste of success came during the Italo-Turkish war where he was promoted to Captain. He would continue to command forces during the Great War where his efforts would lead him to become the youngest Colonel in the Italian Army. Following Italy's victory against the Central Powers in 1919 Graziani became very influential on the affairs of Italy's newly gained possessions. He became infamous for his willingness to use any means necessary to assert Italian dominance over the local populations. With help from the local Greeks and in Panfilia, Graziani lead a brutal suppression of Turks in the region accused of supporting the Turkish National Movement. In Italian Cameroon he defeated a short lived guerrilla movement, forcing much of the civilian population into concentration camps and burning down thousands of square miles of jungle in the process. In Italy he is seen by many as a great Pacifier but those who have been the target of his wrath call him a butcher. Graziani is deeply conservative and believes that strong and iron fisted authority is needed to solve Italy's internal problems.\n§GNotes:§W\n-Tyrannical Authoritarian\n-Unprepared for another 'Great War'\n-Politically ambitious"
