### Events ###
carspain.0.t: "The Nationalist Coalition"
carspain.0.d: "Since the marriage of King Ferdinand II of Aragon and Queen Isabella I of Castille, Spain has been one united nationstate. Following this union, a Golden Age came upon the new Spanish Empire. The empire found and expanded into the New World, bringing civilization and Christendom to the Americas. \n\nSince then, Spain has become ever weaker. It reached its weakest point with the establishment of the Republic in 1931. The Empire was divided both externally and internally, with Socialists and Republicans trying to destroy the Spanish nation. We had no choice but to react when civil war was thrust upon Spain. We had to save Spain from both external and internal enemies. \n\nWe - Nationalists, Falangists, National Syndicalists and many others - united in Spanish patriotism, have formed a Nationalist front and a coalition to fight against the Republicans and the Socialists. We will launch a Reconquista against them, bringing Spain into a new Golden Age! One that will be Eternal!"
carspain.0.a: "Ready a New Reconquista!"

carspain.1.t: "Galician Discontentment"
carspain.1.d: "While Galicia is more inclined to fight for conservative forces than for socialists or republicans, there are still some that sees themselves as a 'nation' of their own. While we need to address Galician nationalism, and other forms of anti-spaniard nationalism, we hope they understand who the real enemy is."
carspain.1.a: "Loyalty to Spain will be Profitable."

carspain.2.t: "Support from Valkists and Nationalists"
carspain.2.d: "With news of our cause reaching the World, support has begun pouring in. From countries like Valkist Germany, the Dutch State, Italy, Norway, and Sweden, Nationalists and Valkists are volunteering for our fight. Especially from our valkist friends in Berlin."
carspain.2.a: "Thank You, Allies of Spain!"

carspain.3.t: "Madrid Under Our Control"
carspain.3.d: "Madrid, the capital of Spain, has fallen under our control. Having the Republican stonghold under our occupation is a massive victory, both in the civil war and in gaining legitimacy internationally."
carspain.3.a: "Long Live the Nation!"

carspain.4.t: "Valencia Under Our Control"
carspain.4.d: "We have managed to push southeast and capture Valencia. It is a beautiful city on the coast that has been under Socialist occupation since the start of the war. With the recapturing of this city, the Socialists will soon be defeated."
carspain.4.a: "Long Live the Nation!"

carspain.5.t: "Barcelona Under Our Control"
carspain.5.d: "We have managed to push east and capture Barcelona. It is one of the most important cities in Spain, and the center of the Socialist revolution. With this city firmly under our control, it will mark the end of the Socialists."
carspain.5.a: "Long Live the Nation!"

carspain.6.t: "Fall of the Republicans!"
carspain.6.d: "The Republicans and the Socialists have finally been defeated. We have managed to defeat the forces that have tried to establish anti-authoritarian regimes in Spain. But while this is a victory for Spain, our country is still divided, now between Alfonsists and Nationalists. Conflict will soon break out."
carspain.6.a: "At Least There are Two Less Foes"

carspain.7.t: "Conflict With the Alfonsists!"
carspain.7.d: "The non-aggression agreement between us and the Alfonsists has been broken. News of clashes on the border have started a conflict once more. It is time to show these pretenders who is the true king of Spain."
carspain.7.a: "The War Continues"

carspain.8.t: "Seville Under Our Control"
carspain.8.d: "We have managed to push south and capture the city of Seville. The city has worked as a base for the Alfonsist forces in Spain, where they have often received British support through Gibraltar. With this victory, the Alfonsist cause is close to total defeat."
carspain.8.a: "Long Live the Nation!"

carspain.9.t: "The Civil War is Over!"
carspain.9.d: "The Spanish civil war is over. After an eternity of fighting, the Nationalists have come out on top. While our success is grand, there will be difficulties following this victory."
carspain.9.a: "Spain is United Again!"

carspain.10.t: "The London Stock Market Crash hits Galicia"
carspain.10.d: "The recent stock market crash in London has come down to Spain. The country is already a bad shape when it comes to our economy. This is not a good sign for us."
carspain.10.a: "We Pray That This Will not Tear Down the Kingdom"

carspain.11.t: "Anti-Government Protests"
carspain.11.d: "Many people have started to blame the Nationalist government for their misery in the aftermath of the London Crash. With war and unemployment, no one is happy that our government focusing too little on the civilians of Spain."
carspain.11.a: "War is War. When Peace Come, it Will be Better"

carspain.12.t: "The London Stock Market Crash hits Spain"
carspain.12.d: "The recent stock market crash in London has come down to Spain. The country is already a bad shape when it comes to our economy. This is not a good sign for us."
carspain.12.a: "We Pray That This Will not Tear Down Spain"

carspain.13.t: "Onésimo Redondo's National Syndicalism"
carspain.13.d: "Onésimo Redondo was a combatant during the civil war, serving as the leader of a radical militia group. During the war, he was injured, which gave him time to study politics. Today, long after the guns have fallen silent, he has appeared in public, with a proclaimation. He has proclaimed that he will enter the politics of post-civil war Spain, with the ideas of National Syndicalism. Many Nationalists are afraid he might be a leftist threat."
carspain.13.a: "Make this Syndicalist 'Go Away'"
carspain.13.b: "He Can't be That Dangerous.."

carspain.14.t: "The Syndicalist Martyr"
carspain.14.d: "The syndicalist Onésimo Redondo was stabbed to death last night in a backalley in Madrid. It was not long before he was made a martyr. Many valkists and national syndicalists believe that he was murdered by socialists and republicans. At least it is good that they suspect them and not us. But this whole incident has given too much attention to this individual and his views."
carspain.14.a: "We Hope He is Better Dead Than Alive"

# Focus Tree Events #

carspain.100.t: "Recruitment Campaign in Nationalist Spain"
carspain.100.d: "Recruitment propaganda in the territories we control seems to be working, with new men offering their services to the forces of the Spanish Nation in droves."
carspain.100.a: "Thank You For Your Participation"

carspain.101.t: "Army Loyalty Reassured"
carspain.101.d: "Colonels in the army who have had a history of being even slightly anti-republican have either been arrested, assassinated, or deported. The government believes that with this, the army's loyalty has been secured to protect Spain."
carspain.101.a: "Long Live Spain!"

carspain.102.t: "Troubles in the Coalition"
carspain.102.d: "The coalition between many nationalist groups, parties, and militias is beginning to show cracks, with a growing resentment between Radicals and Conservatives, Valkists and Traditionalists, National Syndicalists and Monarchists. These resentments have the possibility to tear up our Nation, giving our defeated enemies time to regroup. That, at least, is something that none of us want."
carspain.102.a: "We Need to Figure This Out!"

carspain.103.t: "The Martyr's Succsessor"
carspain.103.d: "While Onésimo Redondo, who can be described as the father of Spanish National Syndicalism, is dead, his ideas are not. In his place Ramiro Ledesma Ramos has become a leader for the National Syndicalists. Together with other radicals, they have organized into the Juntas Castellanas de Actuación Hispánica. This faction, with inspiration and support from Valkist Germany, might pose a threat to the Coalition, and our own personal power. But they might also be a potential ally in the power struggle that seems to inevitable."
carspain.103.a: "Better Them Than the Traditionalists!"
carspain.103.b: "We Are Strong Enough on Our Own!"

carspain.104.t: "The Primo de Rivera - Ledesma Ramos Pact"
carspain.104.d: "José Antonio Primo de Rivera and Ramiro Ledesma Ramos have met today and agreed to cooperate. While the Falangists and the National Syndicalists have some differences, we have managed to form a kind of political alliance. With the threat of the conservative Traditionalists being more important than the threat of the most outspoken radicals, this alliance makes sense. It is we that will bring Spain into the future, not crash it into the past. Our enemies might claim we are just a German puppet, but together, we will show them that we are the Spanish Nation."
carspain.104.a: "For the Spanish Destiny and Our Spanish Future!"

carspain.105.t: "Purging the Traditionalists"
carspain.105.d: "With our power and influence strengthened, it is time to remove the Traditionalists from positions of importance. They pose a threat we can not let loose. We need to pin them down, and remove them. With this done, there is truly nothing that can pose a threat internally to the power of the Spanish Nation. This will, however, not resonate well with the most conservative parts of our population. Hopefully they will understand the importance of a stable rule."
carspain.105.a: "The Future Belongs to the Phalanx!"

carspain.106.t: "Stability Returns"
carspain.106.d: "With opposition curtailed, stability has had the chance to return to Spain. José Antonio Primo de Rivera has spoken for his followers, promising that Spaniards will no longer live in fear of the corrupting rule of Republicans, Socialists, or Monarchists. The road to Spanish Destiny lies at our feet."
carspain.106.a: "Long Live the Nation!"

carspain.107.t: "Purges Fail"
carspain.107.d: "In trying to oppose the influence and power of the Traditionalists and Monarchists among our ranks, we have been met with stiff opposition. Traditionalists have begun to mount a military opposition against our attempts to purge them. We have gotten little to no support from the radical National Syndicalists in this, with some of them forming a third side in this conflict. This might be the end of our vision for Spain."
carspain.107.a: "That's a Bugger!"

carspain.108.t: "The Traditionalist Coup"
carspain.108.d: "News has arrived that traditionalist leaders have led bands of soldiers into the towns and cities of Spain. Even here, in the capital of Madrid, fights have broken out between troops loyal to us and those loyal to the traditionalist militias. In this mess and confusion, a letter has been transferred to our leader, José Antonio Primo de Rivera, from Ramiro Ledesma Ramos, the leader of the National Syndicalists. He is offering his support against the traditionalist threat. It might be a good idea to agree, even if his group would gain more power and influence."
carspain.108.a: "We Can Win This Alone!"
carspain.108.b: "We Need to Accept Their Help!"

carspain.109.t: "The Victory of the Spanish Nationalist Party"
carspain.109.d: "Traditionalists, Monarchists, and Conservative Nationalists. All of them have united in the Spanish Nationalist Party to oppose the Phalanx. Today, they stormed the government buildings of Spain, tearing down the rule of José Antonio Primo de Rivera. Out of this, a strong, proud and independent Spain will rise. A Spain true to tradition, God, and monarchy."
carspain.109.a: "Long Live the Nation! Long Live Spain!"

carspain.110.t: "A Nation Saved?!"
carspain.110.d: "The Traditionalist threat has finally been beaten back, bringing some stability back to Spain. But even with this, the popularity of the Radicals, National Syndicalists, and Valkists, has risen. They are seen as the saviour of the people and nation of Spain, a view that might make them more powerful than us."
carspain.110.a: "We will see Where This Leads..."

carspain.111.t: "The Game For Spain"
carspain.111.d: "Much intrigue has taken hold in the nation, as factions form in support of either Primo de Rivera or Ledesma Ramos. The latter of the two has now come forward with a proposed arrangement, that would effectivly put the radicals in charge of Spain. It is up to the government to accept or reject it."
carspain.111.a: "Maybe Minor Concessions, But Not This"
carspain.111.b: "To Keep the Nation Safe, We Must Agree"

carspain.112.t: "Ramiro Ledesma Ramos Takes Command"
carspain.112.d: "With José Antonio Primo de Rivera agreeing to the proposed arrangement from the radicals, led by Ramiro Ledesma Ramos, a change in power has taken place. The National Syndicalists, Radicals, and Valkists have now secured a stronger position in the nation. No longer will it be the Aristocratic and Conservative Phalanx that will rule Spain."
carspain.112.a: "Long Live the Nation!"

carspain.113.t: "Javier de Borbón-Parma Crowned King of Spain"
carspain.113.d: "Today, Javier de Borbón-Parma, one of the Carlist claimants to the Spanish throne, was crowned the King of Spain. With celebration all across Madrid, the new sovereign was welcomed by a splendid show of loyalty from the citizens of the Spanish nation."
carspain.113.a: "Long Live the King!"

carspain.114.t: "Jaime de Borbón Crowned King of Spain"
carspain.114.d: "Today, Jaime de Borbón, one of the Alfonsist claimants to the Spanish throne, was crowned the King of Spain. With celebration all across Madrid, the new sovereign was welcomed by a show of loyalty from the citizens of the Spanish nation."
carspain.114.a: "Long Live the King!"

carspain.150.t: "The Spanish State Wants to Join the Stahlpakt"
carspain.150.d: "Our nationalist friends in the Spanish State approached us today in order to request entry into the Stahlpakt. With them on our side, our alliance would secure an extra ally that can help us surround and defeat France. The downside would be that we might need to provide for Spain's own defence if war should come."
carspain.150.a: "They Are Welcomed!"
carspain.150.b: "Sorry, but no"

carspain.151.t: "The Germans Accept us Into the Stahlpakt"
carspain.151.d: "The German Reich has answered our request to join the Stahlpakt. Fortunately for us, they have accepted our peitition to join their alliance! With Germany as our ally, our position in the world will be strenghtened. Together, we will build a new world order, stop the socialist evil of the Soviet Union, and stand as an opposing force against the imperialism of France and the United Kingdom."
carspain.151.a: "Spain and Germany Will Fight Together!"

carspain.152.t: "The Germans Reject Our Entry Into the Stahlpakt"
carspain.152.d: "The German Reich has answered our request to join the Stahlpakt. Unfortunately, they have rejected our petition to enter their alliance. While this rejection is disheartening, the fact that they still consider us the legitimate government of Spain may be a glimmer of hope. Our government will take this as a loss for Germany."
carspain.152.a: "This Will be Their Loss"

carspain.153.t: "Our Contacts in Berlin"
carspain.153.d: "The ties between the rising powers of Spain and Germany are clear. Previously united under Charles the Great, the two were powerful entities together at the turn of the 1500s. Gradually, both powers have seen decline, but today, have managed to establish strong governments. We might even be able to take revenge for the pain the French and British have caused us."
carspain.153.a: "Springtime for Spain and Germany!"

carspain.154.t: "Promoting Hispanismo"
carspain.154.d: "Meeting with representatives from Latin-American countries, political organizations, and governments, we have gotten into contact with some quite influential people in the New World. We have proposed the idea of Hispanismo, arguring that Spanish-speaking countries and areas must unite into a new Spanish nation. This might be met with opposition from both regional nationalists in South America, as well as from those who are afraid of the re-establishment of the pre-independence caste system. There is also the United States, who we need to keep in mind. They would not like our ambitions in the Americas."
carspain.154.a: "Viva el Hispanismo!"

carspain.160.t: "International Recognition is Growing"
carspain.160.d: "There is a growing recognition out in the world of our regime. While it is still quite low, it is good to know that there are those that know that we are the true government of Spain."
carspain.160.a: "Long Live Spain!"

carspain.161.d: "There is a growing recognition out in the world of our regime. With more and more people, countries and organization recognizing our legitimacy, this have made things slightly easier. Still, there are many not recognizing the true government of Spain."

carspain.162.d: "There is a growing recognition out in the world of our regime. While there is a majority of foreign countries that recognize us, there are still some that does not. At least we can say that most countries do see us as the true government of Spain."

carspain.163.d: "There is a growing recognition out in the world of our regime. Now, it is just those that strongly support the other factions, and strongly oppose us, that don't recognize us. We can truly proclaim with the worlds agreement, that we are the true government of Spain."

carspain.165.t: "International Trade Recognition"
carspain.165.d: "There is some countries that do not recognize us as the true and legitimate government of Spain. But with growing merchant trade and exports, we see countries previously staying away from us approaching us as a new trade partner. This, in effect, strengthen the international recognition of us."
carspain.165.a: "With Trade Comes Growth"
