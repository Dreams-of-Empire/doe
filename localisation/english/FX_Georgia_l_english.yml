####BRIEF HISTORY
GEO_FUHRERREDUX_DESC: "100 years have passed, and Georgia has finally regained its independence when the Russian Empire crumbled. Lead by the Georgian Menshevik Party, the country quickly adopted Social Democratic reforms and developed rapidly. However, after the 1934 elections the party has become increasingly split between a faction that wants to quickly abolish capitalism, and a faction that is more in favor of gradual development of society. The split has emboldened Georgia's smaller parties, and it looks like if the political situation doesn't stabilize quickly radical new players can enter the political field."

####EVENTS
ge.100000.t: "Georgia's Situation in 1936"
ge.100000.d: "After the October Revolution, the Russian Transcaucasian province broke off and formed the Transcaucasian Federation. However this state wasn't long for the world, as it soon broke into Armenia, Azerbaijan and Georgia. Seeing as the war's end would not come soon, the Georgians, lead by the Menshevik Party, invited the Germans to occupy Georgia (and protect them from the Ottomans).\nThe Georgians didn't take sides in the Russian Civil War, and while the Bolsheviks were initially hostile, in 1920 Georgia signed a peace agreement with the Soviet Union, which established the Bolshevik Party as a legal political party.\nAs the years went by, a new faction developed in the Menshevik Party. The Radicals have received renewed interest as the progress towards socialism seemed to halt. They weren't a major threat until recently, when they started advocating for Georgia to quickly transition to Libertarian Socialism. The current government of Georgia is from the moderate faction, those who are against quickly changing society. The Chairman of Georgia, Akaki Chkhenkeli, who has been elected after a constitutional amendment that abolished term limits and extended the term of the Chairman, has a strong stance in favor of stability. However it seems like the radical faction gains more and more popularity every month..."
ge.100000.a: "Mretsveloba Gadaarchens Sakartvelos!"

ge.1000.t: "Ioseb Jugashvili Resurfaces"
ge.1000.d: "It seemed like after Jugashvili's long disgraceful exile from the Soviet Union due to his "comrades" in the Soviet leadership, he would never return to what he used to be. But it seems that we have misjudged him, since we have received reports of him inciting people against our government and forming a new party. He even tried to adopt his old nickname, 'Stalin', though without much success."
ge.1000.a: "Leave him alone"
ge.1000.b: "Imprison him for incitement"
ge.1000.c: "Bring someone to convince him that he's wrong"

ge.1001.t: "Jugashvili's Mother Convinces Him to Change His Ways"
ge.1001.d: "We have brought Jugashvili's mother, Keke Geladze, over to Jugashvili, in order for her to convince him to stop his rebellious activities and take care of her in her old age. It was obvious that even after all of these years, Jugashvili was still afraid of his mother and has promised to listen to her."
ge.1001.a: "He hated his father, but he loved his mother."

ge.1002.t: "Jugashvili's Meeting with His Mother Failed"
ge.1002.d: "We have brought Jugashvili's mother, Keke Geladze, over to Jugashvili, in order for her to convince him to stop his rebellious activities and take care of her in her old age. Unfortunately, while Jugashvili made efforts to appear respectful, it was obvious he wasn't going to listen to her and that he would return to his National Collectivist activities as soon as he could."
ge.1002.a: "Is National Collectivism stronger than a boy's bond to his mother?"

ge.1003.t: "Zhordania Convinces Jugashvili that the Mensheviks have the right path"
ge.1003.d: "It seems like Zhordania has done the impossible. After a long meeting with Ioseb Jugashvili, in which the two discussed revolutionary matters and the old times, it seems like Zhordania has managed to convince Jugashvili that Bolshevism has failed and that the Mensheviks will lead the Socialist revolution. Jugashvili even promised to join the Menshevik Party and support it!"
ge.1003.a: "Isn't it great when two old Amkhanagebo reunite?"

ge.1004.t: "Jugashvili Storms out of the Meeting with Zhordania"
ge.1004.d: "Have we really expected anything different? Even though nobody could question the validity of Zhordania's arguments, Jugashvili has managed to do so anyway. There is no convincing this kind of nut. It seems like this meeting only made him even more convinced of the need to overthrow the government."
ge.1004.a: "Jugashvili is truly an insult to Socialism."

ge.1100.t: "The Coup in Georgia"
ge.1100.d: "Early in today's morning many independent cells of National Collectivist revolutionaries took over governmental and public buildings all over Tbilisi. Simultaneously, other groups have took over other cities, like Batumi, Kutaisi, Poti and Sokhumi. Amidst all of the confusion, an attempt was made to imprison key people in Georgian politics, but fortunately nearly all of those attempts failed and the politicians are now preparing to escape from the country."
ge.1100.a: "This is a dark time for our country."

ge.1101.t: "Jughasvili renames Tbilisi!"
ge.1101.d: "Nobody saw this coming. Ioseb Jughashvili suddenly announced in a meeting of the Marxist Party that he will rename Tbilisi to Kobaisi, a name more befitting for the capital of the socialist nation as it is the name of the bandit protagonist in the Georgian book 'The Patricide'. Those that are old enough to remember know that this is just a ploy to rename the capital of Georgia to Ioseb's name, as Koba was his underground nickname in the Tsarist era. But they dare not speak out..."
ge.1101.a: "Is there no limit to this man's madness?!"

ge.1500.t: "Beria is Accused of Doing Indecent Acts with Army Women"
ge.1500.d: "Ever since we have allowed for the conscription of women, we have started to receive more and more complaints from women who have been assigned to work with Beria that he is doing indecent acts near them. How should we proceed?"
ge.1500.a: "Let it slide"
ge.1500.b: "Put him on trial"
ge.1500.c: "Send him to a psychiatrist"

ge.1501.t: "Beria Reacts Well to Treatment"
ge.1501.d: "We have sent Beria to a psychiatrist. After a few meetings, the psychiatrist has told us that Beria was reacting well to treatment and that in a few months he should be mentally healthy again."
ge.1501.a: "We should socialize mental healthcare to prevent such cases from happening in the first place"

ge.1502.t: "Beria Has Finished His Treatment"
ge.1502.d: "A man comes out of the psychiatrist's office. On first sight it seems to be the same man we sent off many months ago, but all of the people who knew him don't know him anymore. This Beria is a different, much more just Beria, and he wants to contribute to society as a show of gratitude for the treatment that he has received."
ge.1502.a: "We shall send him to officer school again to become a better field marshal"
ge.1502.b: "This man would make a great head of intelligence."

ge.1503.t: "Beria Didn't React Well to Treatment"
ge.1503.d: "It was obvious from the start that this isn't going to work. Beria is too set in his sadistic ways to ever change. Sadly, we can't do anything."
ge.1503.a: "How unfortunate."

ge.1.t: "Manganese Miners Go on Strike!"
ge.1.d: "With the recent London Stock Market Crash, the Manganese prices crashed, and the mine owners were forced to lower the wages of the Manganese miners. However, they didn't anticipate the strong reaction their actions have caused amongst the miners. The miners have gone on strike, and other trade unions are on the verge of striking too, out of solidarity and fear for their own jobs. While we anticipate the Crash won't affect us much more, the radical Mensheviks have exploited the occasion to exit the coalition, gaining a lot of new followers and necessitating new elections as the government no longer has a majority to support it."
ge.1.a: "Unfortunately, the elections must happen earlier than expected."
ge.1.b: "Magram me megona rom mretsveloba gadaarchenda sakartvelos!"

ge.2.t: "Elections!"
ge.2.d: "While the elections were only planned to be held in the next year, they went smoothly regardless and people from all over the country voted. These are also the first elections since the 1934 constitutional amendment that abolished term limits on chairmans and extended their terms to three years. The results are in. The winner of the elections is:"
ge.2.a: "The moderate faction!"
ge.2.b: "The radical faction!"

ge.3.t: "Snap Elections!"
ge.3.d: "After the coalition collapsed the old Menshevik party has lost a lot of its popularity, so now is the chance for the formerly small parties to shine. The winner of the elections is:"
ge.3.a: "The Socialist-Federalist Party!"
ge.3.b: "The National Democratic Party!"

ge.10.t: "Monarchy Referendum!"
ge.10.d: "A controversial decision has been made by the coalition government to make a referendum about reforming the country into a constitutional monarchy and restorating the Bagrationi-Mukhrani dynasty to the Georgian throne. While at first everyone has thought this referendum had no chance of succeeding and was just a move to please the conservatives and the church, we now realise the referendum has a real chance of succeeding, due to a fervent campaign from the Georgian Orthodox Church."
ge.10.a: "The Monarchy is restored!"
ge.10.b: "The Republic is kept!"

ge.100.t: "Georgia Proposes Building a Transcaucasian Railway"
ge.100.d: "Georgia has proposed expanding the current railway systems and linking them together for the betterment of our infrastructure. While some of our ministers oppose this as a Georgian scheme to get control of our infrastructure, others point out the obvious benefits."
ge.100.a: "We accept their proposal."
ge.100.b: "We will never deal with perfidious Iberia!"

ge.110.t: "The Georgians Request Arbitration Between Them and Separatists"
ge.110.d: "Georgia has long had a problem with separatism in their country. Ever since the days of feudalism Georgia was divided into different parts and even today they don't all share the same culture. We were requested to serve as a neutral arbitrator between them and their separatists to restore the peace."
ge.110.a: "The separatist regions deserve more autonomy."
ge.110.b: "Georgia is right, they already have enough autonomy as it is."

ge.115.t: "Georgia offers rapprochement"
ge.115.d: "The Georgians are seeking rapprochement with us, possibly because of our recent government change that made us closer to each other ideologically. While we did have plans to conquer the region, we could forgo them in favor of good relations and mutually beneficial cooperation."
ge.115.a: "Our Georgian comrades deserve to live in peace, we accept."
ge.115.b: "Georgia's socialism is fake! They're exploiting workers as we speak. We'll never accept!"

ge.116.t: "Soviets accept rapprochement"
ge.116.d: "The Soviets have accepted our offer of rapprochement, and our relations and trade are improving slowly but surely. We don't have to be worried about a Soviet invasion anymore."
ge.116.a: "Great news!"

ge.117.t: "Soviets reject rapprochement"
ge.117.d: "Unfortunately, the Soviets have rejected our offer of rapprochement. They claim our socialism is fake and that Georgia is an oppressive bourgeoisie dictatorship. We have to expect an invasion from them soon."
ge.117.a: "Those perfidious Soviets are not to be trusted."

ge.120.t: "The Soviets Demand a Referendum in Sochi"
ge.120.d: "The Russians have long considered Sochi to be a part of their core territory, and now that we have joined the Soviet Union they demand a referendum to figure out this issue once and for all."
ge.120.a: "We haven't thought about this when we joined the Soviet Union"

ge.121.t: "Should We Cheat in the Sochi Referendum?"
ge.121.d: "After the Georgian government has announced that a referendum will be held in Sochi to determine in which SSR it will be, some people have suggested that the Sochi population would be brainwashed by the Georgians to not accept our rightful ownership of their lands. They say that the Russian SFSR certainly has the power to affect the referendum to be slightly in our favor. What should we do?"
ge.121.a: "The Sochi folk don't know what's good for them!"
ge.121.b: "We will win anyway, why cheat?"

ge.122.t: "Sochi Stays Georgian"
ge.122.d: "The referendum has ended, and the votes were counted. By large majority, the people of Sochi have chosen to stay Georgian!"
ge.122.a: "Three cheers for Sakartvelo!"

ge.123.t: "Sochi Has Chosen to Go with Russia"
ge.123.d: "The referendum has ended, and the votes were counted. The people of Sochi voted to be annexed by the Russian SFSR. While some ministers have suggested that the Russians have cheated in the referendum, we can't do a thing."
ge.123.a: "The people of Sochi have made their choice."

ge.130.t: "Georgia asks to join the Third Internationale"
ge.130.d: "Due to our recent warming of relations with Georgia, the Georgian government has requested that we allow them to join our faction, the Third Internationale. Our cabinet is pretty split on the issue, with some saying we should accept them into the alliance and others saying they would be more of a liability."
ge.130.a: "We accept them into our alliance."
ge.130.b: "We will only guarantee their independence"
ge.130.c: "We cannot deepen our relations like that."

ge.131.t: "The Soviets have accepted our request for an alliance!"
ge.131.d: "Fortunately, the Soviets have agreed to our request to join their alliance and we are now a part of the Third Internationale."
ge.131.a: "Workers of the world, unite!"

ge.132.t: "The Soviets have rejected our request for an alliance!"
ge.132.d: "Unfortunately, the Soviets have rejected our request for an alliance. It seems like they still don't consider us their comrades."
ge.132.a: "Lenin's legacy is still felt in Moscow."

ge.133.t: "The Soviets have guaranteed our independence!"
ge.133.d: "While the Soviets have not accepted us as members of the Third Internationale, they have guaranteed our independence."
ge.133.a: "Something is better than nothing, right?"

ge.140.t: "Georgia proposes we start Transcaucasian talks"
ge.140.d: "Georgia has come to us with an offer to begin talks between us and them about unifying our countries in order to be able to stand up to outside threats together. However, there is one condition: if we accept, we pledge to conduct a referendum on the formation of Transcaucasia at the end of the talks. Also, we must forgo our territorial claims on the other parties to the talks."
ge.140.a: "We must unite in these troublous times."
ge.140.b: "We will never agree to these terms!"

ge.141.t: "[From.GetName] refuses to Transcaucasian talks!"
ge.141.d: "Unfortunately, the diplomats of [From.GetName] were not brave enough to forget about our differences to unite against our common enemies. Unfortunately, the whole region will suffer the results, as without the critical participation of [From.GetName] in our talks we cannot continue with our Transcaucasian plan."
ge.141.a: "They've made a terrible mistake. Now we shall all suffer the consequences."

ge.150.t: "Georgian-Armenian Talks"
ge.150.d: "We have met with the representatives of Armenia to discuss them joining a hypothetical Transcaucasian federation. While the meeting went positively, everyone noticed that the Armenians waited for a territorial concession from us."
ge.150.a: "Give them Tao-Klarjeti"
ge.150.b: "Give them Lori"
ge.150.c: "Don't give them anything"

ge.151.t: "Georgian-Azeri Talks"
ge.151.d: "We have met with the representatives of Azerbaijan to discuss them joining a hypothetical Transcaucasian federation. The meeting went very smoothly, and most Azeri representatives seemed to like the idea. However, some of the more nationalist ones have mentioned that we hold rightful Azeri territories."
ge.151.a: "Give them Zaqatala"
ge.151.b: "Don't give them anything"

ge.152.t: "The Transcaucasian Referendum!"
ge.152.d: "Millions of people, all over Transcaucasia, will vote today in the referendum about the reformation of the Transcaucasian federation. Now it doesn't matter what the politicians think of this, only what the people think."
ge.152.a: "We await the results, patiently but excitedly."

ge.153.t: "The Transcaucasian Referendum!"
ge.153.d: "Millions of people, all over Transcaucasia, will vote today in the referendum about the reformation of the Transcaucasian federation. Now it doesn't matter what the politicians think of this, only what the people think."
ge.153.a: "Have we made the right decision when we cooperated with this initiative?"

ge.154.t: "The results from the referendum are here!"
ge.154.d: "We finished counting all of the votes, and so did the other republics. No matter what the results are, our nations have come closer during this period, and it's likely that even if the referendum fails we will still create an economic and military union. Regardless, the results are:"
ge.154.a: "The people have voted to form Transcaucasia!"
ge.154.b: "The people have against forming Transcaucasia, however we shall still form an economic and military union."

ge.155.t: "The People Support Transcaucasia!"
ge.155.d: "The results of the referendum were clear. The Transcaucasian people want to reform the Transcaucasian Federation. We are already in talks with Azerbaijan and Armenia about the technical details of this reunion."
ge.155.a: "From now on, we have the same enemies and friends."

ge.156.t: "The People Voted Against Transcaucasia"
ge.156.d: "The results of the referendum were clear. The Transcaucasian people don't want to reform the Transcaucasian Federation. However, since we have already established friendly relations with the Transcaucasian governments we have agreed to form an economic and military union despite the political union being off the table."
ge.156.a: "This is still something, right?"

ge.159.t: "Georgia demands a plebiscite in Trapizon"
ge.159.d: "The insane Georgians have come up with a new demand. They want the area of Trapizon to vote on whether it should remain Armenian or join Georgia. This is a preposterous demand, but they've threatened to declare war on us if we refuse."
ge.159.a: "We'll allow it"
ge.159.b: "They will get a plebiscite in their dreams"

ge.160.t: "Trapizoni votes to join Georgia"
ge.160.d: "People all over Trapizoni have voted today for their territory to join Georgia. While the Armenian government is still sore about this issue, the people of Trapizoni have spoken and the Armenians can do nothing about this."
ge.160.a: "They hate Georgians less than they hate Armenians."

ge.161.t: "Trapizoni votes to remain in Armenia"
ge.161.d: "People all over Trapizoni have voted today for their territory to remain in Armenia. We are still not sure why they did this, but the Armenians have got to be behind this."
ge.161.a: "They've cheated! This means war!"

ge.162.t: "Armenia refuses to hold the plebiscite!"
ge.162.d: "Armenia has not listened to our demands, ignoring our ultimatum. They probably thought they couldn't win the plebiscite, but no matter. We'll get that region one way or another."
ge.162.a: "Very well then. They shall face the consequences."

ge.163.t: "Trapizoni votes to join Georgia"
ge.163.d: "People all over Trapizoni have voted today for their territory to join Georgia. We're not sure how they did it, but it's possible they managed to bribe over the population or somehow infiltrate the vote counting committee."
ge.163.a: "We were wrong to trust them to play fairly."

ge.164.t: "Trapizoni votes to remain in Armenia"
ge.164.d: "People all over Trapizoni have voted today for their territory to remain in Armenia. Unfortunately, Georgia already declared the results of the plebiscite to be fake and have declared war on us."
ge.164.a: "They're just sore losers!"

ge.170.t: "The Georgians Want to Join the Stahlpakt"
ge.170.d: "We were surprised when we received a message from the Georgian government about them wanting to join the Stahlpakt. While we already cooperated in the Great War, this sentiment was still unexpected. We suspect they want to leverage us to demand concessions from the Soviets."
ge.170.a: "The more the merrier"
ge.170.b: "Georgia is nothing but a burden"

ge.171.t: "Germany has rejected our alliance offer"
ge.171.d: "Germany has rejected our alliance offer. We suspect they did it because of them being afraid of the Soviets attacking us and them having to intervene. Regardless, this makes our chances of survival against the Soviets a lot lower."
ge.171.a: "It's their loss!"

ge.180.t: "The Georgians Demand North Caucasia"
ge.180.d: "Those little brats over at Georgia think they have enough might to demand that we hand them over North Caucasia. While we can only laugh at them threatening us, perhaps handing them over this insignificant territory is a good way to get rid of it and its instability."
ge.180.a: "Sure, they can have it"
ge.180.b: "What, are you kidding me?"

ge.185.t: "Georgia demands Azarbaijan!"
ge.185.d: "Ever since Jugashvili came to power in Georgia, they've been acting more and more insane. Their latest act was to demand Azarbaijan from us, threatening to take it by force if we refuse. While they're utterly insane, they've invested heavily into militarization so perhaps fighting them isn't the best idea."
ge.185.a: "We have to give it to them, they are too crazy!"
ge.185.b: "Them? Defeating us? We've never heard a joke as funny as this."

ge.186.t: "Persia refused to give us Azarbaijan!"
ge.186.d: "They've laughed our diplomats off, and when they realized we are serious they've expelled our diplomats and gave us a warning not to threaten them again. Clearly, they've lost their minds! They will learn what the Georgian People's Might means!"
ge.186.a: "We must punish them for their insolence!"

ge.187.t: "Persia agreed to give us Azarbaijan!"
ge.187.d: "They knew how serious we were the moment our diplomats came in with the demand. They've quickly agreed to our terms and Azarbaijan is now controlled by us."
ge.187.a: "They are saved, for now."

ge.190.t: "The Georgians Request a Guarantee for Their Independence"
ge.190.d: "We have had a friendly relationship with the Georgian government ever since we supported their independence after the Great War, despite a few hiccups along the way. Now they came to us and asked for a guarantee for their independence against the Soviet aggression and any other countries that seek to invade them. While such a guarantee might be benefitial to us diplomatically, a war in such a far away place could be dangerous to intervene in."
ge.190.a: "Very well, we can guarantee them."
ge.190.b: "They can deal with it on their own."

ge.191.t: "The British Deny Our Request of a Guarantee"
ge.191.d: "We shouldn't have expected anything else. The British have clarified that we couldn't expect any sort of a guarantee for their independence that would require them to go to war in our aid."
ge.191.a: "Perfidious Albion Strikes Again!"
ge.191.b: "We turn to France in this hour of need."

ge.192.t: "The Georgians Request a Guarantee for Their Independence"
ge.192.d: "We didn't deal much with the Georgians, but they still request a guarantee for their independence, mostly to prevent the Soviet Union from attacking them. They clarify that they have asked the British for a guarantee, but they have turned them down. Accepting this could strengthen us diplomatically, but a war in a far away place could be dangerous to intervene in."
ge.192.a: "We shall guarantee their independence."
ge.192.b: "They can search for their friends someplace else."

ge.195.t: "Transcaucasia proposes that we join their federation"
ge.195.d: "We've had good relations with the Georgians and the Azerbaijanis for a long time. Because of the international situation, it made sense for them to propose that we join their federation in order to defend against foreign threats tofeth. But this means giving up our independence, the exact same thing we were trying to avoid..."
ge.195.a: "We will join their federation."
ge.195.b: "We can't give up our independence!"

ge.199.t: "The Transcaucasian Elections"
ge.199.desc: "The time for new elections has come. While in the past the parties were divided by political ideology, we have seen the traditional parties of the Transcaucasian countries shift into parties that represent their entire nation."
ge.199.a: "The Georgian Candidate Wins"
ge.199.b: "The Armenian Candidate Wins"
ge.199.c: "The Azeri Candidate Wins"
ge.199.d: "An Underdog Wins! Peri-Khan Sofieva shall become our leader."

ge.200.t: "The Georgians request that we arm them"
ge.200.d: "Georgia has always been a country at the heart of our caucasian interests. Now that they are expanding their army, they have figured that it would be best to ask us to supply them with their much coveted arms. While they don't really have much to pay with, they have promised they will be eternally grateful."
ge.200.a: "Why not?"
ge.200.b: "Why would we ever do that?"

ge.201.t: "[From.GetName] has refused to give us weapons!"
ge.201.d: "Unfortunately, [From.GetName] has refused to give us weapons even though we tried to convince them that it would be beneficial for them too. After this we have learned to lower our expectations of international aid to our country."
ge.201.a: "What a shame."

ge.250.t: "The Battleship Has Finished Construction"
ge.250.d: "Our battleship, the crown jewel in our new navy, has finally been completed and will now join the rest of our navy."
ge.250.a: "Hurray!"

ge.260.t: "Propose Peace to the Turks?"
ge.260.d: "We are receiving reports from the battlefield that we are winning in Turkey and that we currently control all of old Trapizoni. We can now propose peace that will ensure our control over this region."
ge.260.a: "Very well, there's no need for more bloodshed than necessary."
ge.260.b: "We will not stop fighting until they unconditionally surrender!"

ge.261.t: "Propose Peace to the Soviets?"
ge.261.d: "We are receiving reports from the battlefield that we are winning in North Caucasia and that we currently control all of our claimed lands. We can now propose peace that will ensure our control over these regions."
ge.261.a: "Very well, there's no need for more bloodshed than necessary."
ge.261.b: "We should also demand our other claims while we're here and wait until they will accept those demands too."

ge.262.t: "Propose Peace to the Soviets?"
ge.262.d: "We are receiving reports from the battlefield that we are winning in our war against the Soviet Union and we currently control all of our claimed lands, including Krasnodar and Crimea. We can now propose peace that will ensure our control over these regions."
ge.262.a: "Very well, there's no need for more bloodshed than necessary."
ge.262.b: "We will not stop fighting until they unconditionally surrender!"

ge.263.t: "The Georgians Propose Peace!"
ge.263.d: "This is a dark time for us. We have laughed at the Georgians when they pressed their ridiculous claims on us, but it seems they had the last laugh. Now they come to us with an offer of peace, and what seemed ridiculous at first seems reasonable now."
ge.263.a: "We have no choice..."
ge.263.b: "Are we really seriously thinking of surrender to these Chveneburi?"
ge.263.c: "The Georgians don't know their place!"

ge.264.t: "Our Peace Offer Didn't Get Accepted!"
ge.264.d: "We were hopeful that the enemy will understand that we won this war, but there wasn't any such luck. The war goes on, but now our people finally begin to understand the monsterous enemy we are facing."
ge.264.a: "Their loss!"

ge.900.t: "The Georgian Volunteers Have Arrived"
ge.900.d: "We were very excited to hear that the first division of Georgian volunteers to our army has arrived. They will be integrated into the Soviet army and will serve at one of the fronts."
ge.900.a: "This shows the strength of our 'friendship'"

ge.910.t: "Georgia Wants to Join Our Alliance"
ge.910.d: "Georgia wants to join our alliance. They feel that they can't sit around while the world is conquered by the enemies of mankind, and after we've given them a guarantee they think that we're their closest allies."
ge.910.a: "Let them join!"
ge.910.b: "They would only be a burden."

ge.911.t: "France Doesn't Want Us in Their Alliance!"
ge.911.d: "We were hopeful that the French would understand that we want to help them. Unfortunately, they didn't want us in their alliance. While they didn't give much of a reason, we suspect it's because they think we are not strong enough to make an impact."
ge.911.a: "Their loss!"

ge.920.t: "Georgia Wants to Join Our Alliance"
ge.920.d: "Georgia wants to join our alliance. They feel that they can't sit around while the world can be conquered by the enemies of mankind, and after we've given them a guarantee they think that we're their closest allies."
ge.920.a: "Let them join!"
ge.920.b: "They would only be a burden."

ge.921.t: "Britain Doesn't Want Us in Their Alliance!"
ge.921.d: "We were hopeful that the British would understand that we want to help them. Unfortunately, they didn't want us in their alliance. While they didn't give much of a reason, we suspect it's because they think we are not strong enough to make an impact."

ge.951.d: "We have proposed for [From.GetName] to join our alliance, and we were as friendly as possible doing it, but they still haven't accepted it."
ge.951.a: "What a shame."

ge.10000.t: "Ekvtime Opens a New Museum Exhibition"
ge.10000.d: "Ekvtime Takaishvili, our most renowned history professor in the Tbilisi State University, was honored in opening up a new exhibition in the Georgian Museum in Tbilisi. The exhibition was about the documents that were in the Transcaucasian archive from the Tsarist era. Among them are some fascinating findings about the extent of the Okhrana infiltration into the Georgian Bolshevik groups, that seem to put a lot of current Georgian Bolsheviks in a bad light."
ge.10000.a: "We'll be sure to check it out!"

ge.10001.t: "The Tbilisi Central Stadium Construction is Complete"
ge.10001.d: "Thousands of football fans cheer as the Tbilisi Central Stadium is opened to the public. While many football teams have been founded in the last dozen of years, often related to various labor unions and cooperatives, they didn't have a central place to compete in. But no more! The new stadium is sure to accommodate any football match!"
ge.10001.a: "Hopefully the football teams can make us proud!"

ge.10002.t: "Chiaureli Releases Arsen"
ge.10002.d: "A new picture came out to Georgian cinemas today. The acclaimed film director Mikheil Chiaureli's new movie Arsen is about a Georgian soldier who returns from the Tsarist army and notices the oppression of the Georgian serfs by the Russian nobles. He organizes a rebellion against the Russians and together with Georgians from all classes who come to volunteer the rebellion expands and becomes a big revolt. Unfortunately the Russians manage to infiltrate the rebellion with agents that encourage the Georgians to surrender to the Russians, and the rebellion votes to accept a peace agreement with the Russians. Arsen leaves the group with his love Neno. \n\nIn the last scene, the results of the surrender are shown. Arsen returns to the once oppressed villages and only finds burnt ruins."
ge.10002.a: "This film shows that we can't trust the Russians."
ge.10002.b: "This only shows that nationalist propaganda is inferior to socialist propaganda."

ge.10003.t: "Chiaureli Releases The Great Dawn"
ge.10003.d: "Chiaureli hits us with another picture. This time, the movie is a satirical take on the October revolution. It shows how a Menshevik that was locked up until the February Revolution see the people's despair in the Great War and listens to a speech by Vladimir Lenin about how the Social Democratic party will bring salvation when it gets in power. Excited by the speech, he joins the Bolshevik faction, and later enlists in the Red Army. \n\nThe movie shows him traveling to different fronts, and being a part of a delegation to Ioseb Jugashvili, then known as Joseph Stalin, to stop the severe human rights violations that they are being forced to do. \n\nUnfortunately for them, Stalin locks all of the delegation up in the same prison he was locked in before and after a show trial attended by Stalin he is ordered to be executed. He manages to break out of the prison, only to meet one of the people he has seen in despair when he was released from that prison in the first place. The person tells him that the other people he saw were from his village and that now they are starving because of the Bolshevik policies and that he is searching for some food that fell off from the shipments to the prison. Saddened by this revelation he tries to escape from Russia. On his way he overhears a speech given by Stalin about how the great dawn of the revolution was broken and he begins to cry."
ge.10003.a: "This is a sobering reminder of the treacherous nature of the Soviets."
ge.10003.b: "Why is nationalist propaganda always so bad?"
ge.10003.c: "We will have a talk with this director."

ge.10004.t: "Georgia Joins the Soviet Union"
ge.10004.d: "[This.GetNewspaperHeader]Following the Soviet invasion of Georgia, this was seemingly inevitable. The Provisional People's Government of Georgia has decided to transform Georgia into the Georgian Soviet Socialist Republic, and has signed all of the relevant treaties that formally adjoin the Georgian SSR and the Soviet Union."
ge.10004.a: "Isn't Georgia a part of America?"
ge.10004.b: "We're reunited at last!"
ge.10004.c: "We welcome our Georgian brothers into the Union!"

ge.10005.t: "Gerzel Baazov publishes the second part of his trilogy 'Petkhaini'!"
ge.10005.d: "Gerzel Baazov, a famous Georgian Jewish poet, writer and playwright, has published the second book of his planned trilogy of books describing the life of Georgian Jews. The first book in the trilogy was met with great acclaim and was praised for accuratly describing the daily life of regular Georgian Jews in the late Russian Empire. The second part focuses on life under democratic Georgia, the ideological conflict between Zionists, non-Zionists and radical revolutionaries. While Gerzel isn't affiliated with any party (he is a Zionist), some have detected criticism of the government in it for limiting Zionist activity in some instances, while others say the book is really a criticism of the Jewish radicals for betraying tradition. Gerzel said that none of them are correct, as the book only tries to describe the Jewish life, not offer critique of it."
ge.10005.a: "We are proud to have such a talented writer!"

GEO_1936_elections: "Elections!"
GEO_1936_elections_desc: "Georgia, which had been a stable country for all of its recent years of independence, is going to have its first elections where the victory of the SSDP is not guaranteed. Even though the SSDP's two wings remain the two biggest parties they cannot rule alone. This means they will have to make some kind of compromise with another party which could undermine them."

GEO_become_SSR: "Joining the Soviet Union"
GEO_become_SSR_desc: "Making a country that is used to freedom and democracy kneel before authoritarian foreign overlords is tough.

GEO_social_market_desc: "It makes no sense to throw away all of the progress we made in social rights just because the old economy system didn't work too well. We shall keep the worker rights and the social safety net our laws provide to private people, swaying ex-Mensheviks to our side."

GEO_armenia_talks: "Compromise with Armenia"
GEO_armenia_talks_desc: "Armenia will be the hardest country to convince. They have territorial claims on both us and Azerbaijan, and had wars with both us and Azerbaijan.

GEO_azerbaijan_talks: "Compromise with Azerbaijan"
GEO_azerbaijan_talks_desc: "We have had friendly relations with Azerbaijan since our independence, but convincing them to be a part of our union will still not be easy.
