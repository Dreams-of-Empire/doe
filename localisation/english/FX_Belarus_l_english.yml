BLR_FUHRERREDUX_DESC: "The belarusian war for independence was led by the bold man, the Ataman, Stanislav Bulak-Balakhovich. Alongside Poles and Ukrainians he fought against Bolsheviks and signed a peace treaty of Riga in 1922. He's the man who brought peace and independence to Belarus, but is there freedom in Belarus? The army keeps its loyalty to the Ataman, but his desire to control politics too resulted in alliance with belarusian national-socialist party and the isolation from neighboring countries. With growing dissatisfaction within his government, the nation was thrown into unrest, with conflicts erupting between his loyalists from the Home Guard and the BNSP"

### Events
belarus.0.t: "Belarus, 1936"
belarus.0.d: "Belarus gained its independence during the February Revolution of 1917 in Russia, the Belarusian National Council was created from representatives from different regions and of political powers. However, both the Germans and the Bolsheviks refuse to recognise the sovereignity of the council, and was not interested with the idea of an independent Belarusian state. With the capture of Minsk by German forces in 1918, the Belarusian Government was forced to left for Lithuania.\n\nThe Soviet Union have attempted to reclaim their former territories in the west, such as territories that now control by the new Polish and Ukrainian states, this has allowed Stanislaw Bulak-Balachowicz, the Otaman to forge an alliance against the Soviets in exchange for lands that were previously occupied by the council. Many saw this as the Otaman selling out the rightful regions that belonged to Belarus and was heavily critized. However, with an alliance secured, the Belarusians succesfully repelled Soviet attacks allowing for the signing of the Peace of Riga in 1922.\n\nWith independence secured, the Otaman was invited to become the President of the new Republic, and oversaw a formal election in 1925, with results in the Hromada victory, which results in the Otaman outing the new government fearing Soviet involvement. By the end of 1929, the Otaman ruled with an iron fist, reverting many popular policies that diped his image. However, 1935, the new National-Socialist Party formed an alliance with the Otaman, forming a new government that admires German Valkism. This has formed a Diarchy between the Otaman and the BNSP as one holds the army and one the government, allowing good sense of cooperation has swept the cabinet meetings between the Home Guard and the BNSP but would it last?"

Under interrogation, it has been found that the assailant is a member of the Socialist-Revolutionary Combat Organization, who have been organizing labour strikes throughout the country and was subsequently dismantled and banned by the Home Guard.\nWhile nation is still in shock to the death of the first President of Belarus, the Home Guard is now preparing a harder crackdown on these leftist elements still lingering the country, and in the affairs of the government, a power struggle now rests between the Home Guard and the BNSP.

### Character Descriptions
LEADER_STANISLAW_BULAK_BALACHOWICZ_DESC: "Born on February 10th, 1883, Stanisław Bułak-Bałachowicz has a relatively unknown early life, but after becoming an agricultural student for 4 years, he began working as an accountant, and shortly after in 1904 became a manager at Count Plater's estates in Horodziec and Łużki.\n\nDuring the Great War, Stanisław Bułak-Bałachowicz volunteered for the Royal Russian Army, and because of his noble lineage, he had been given medals at the very start. But that wasn't all he got, for he proved himself to be a talented military mastermind, who fought the Germans in Warsaw with his Cossack Cavalry. He was forced to retreat to Latvia due to the overwhelming German advance, and had fought on from there with his brave and inflexible Cossack brigades. His fight left him with multiple Russian badges and awards for his amazing talent. Bałachowicz didn't know that the treaty of Brest-Litovsk was signed and still fought on despite not being at war, and this almost cost his life, for he had gotten shot in his left lung, and left the front a while later.\n\nDuring the Russian Civil War, Stanisław Bułak-Bałachowicz joined up with the Polish, Latvian, and Lithuanian resistance fighters to break into the bolshevik invasion, and despite showing signs of disloyalty, he did his job well. Hearing about the Belarusian Uprisings in the revolution, Stanisław Bułak-Bałachowicz joined the Belarusian army and formed the Belarusian National Guard or the BNG. Fighting well and well, Bałachowicz was hailed as a hero of the Belarusians, and continued his fight until independence was unquestionable.\n\nHaving a short stint as leader of Belarus, Bałachowicz stepped down from power, but kept his political career ongoing. With his overwhelming amount of support and loyalty from the population and military, Stanisław Bułak-Bałachowicz had become one of the most powerful men in Belarusian history and kept his eye over the country until the present day, with his power over the country fully being achieved when he preformed a coup on Belarus."
