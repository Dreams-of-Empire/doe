UKR_FUHRERREDUX_DESC: "The collapse of the Russian Empire, have allowed the Ukrainians to establish their own state along the Dnieper, however, the German Empire quickly established a puppet state but was forced to evacuate the region following the German revolution of 1918. As so, the Ukrainian People's Republic was re-established, and thrown into the chaos of the Russian Civil War. Coming out victorious against the Bolsheviks, the Ukrainians seeked to distance themselves from Russia, creating a unique identity wedged between Soviet Russia and a resurgent Germany. With tensions once more rising in Europe, Ukraine must place her bets and pick a side, or be lost to the annals of time."

UKR_shock_and_awe: "Shock and Awe"
UKR_shock_and_awe_desc: "Sometimes, using artillery fire is necessary not so much for defeating the enemy, as much as disorganising and discombobulating it. Effective campaign of such allows the enemy to show its weakness, which is why we should invest in artillery most effective in this department."
UKR_logistics_improvements: "Logistics Improvements"
UKR_logistics_improvements_desc: "Although our largely flat terrain is usually seen as a disadvantage, there is one key upside to it. That is, the ease of logistical supply. Taking steps to ensure we can keep continuously supplying our troops is our current chief directive."
UKR_reverse_engineering: "Reverse Engineering"
UKR_reverse_engineering_desc: "Experimentation in the Tanking Department (centralized around the Kharkiv Locomotive Factory) is something that we've been engaging in for almost a decade now and it seems like our efforts have started to bear fruit, spearheaded by Junior Officer Ivan Cherniakhovskyi. We should take steps to deploy our prototypes on the field."
UKR_utilize_motor_factories: "Utilize Motor Factories"

UKR_modernize_artillery: "Modernize Artillery"
UKR_modernize_artillery_desc: "There's little more effective in warring than a punishing barrage of firepower on any given target. Effectiveness of such strategies increases even further in the event of utilising specialized artillery in divisions. Which we shall do."

UKR_production_quotas_desc: "Many of the military setbacks of the former Russian Empire in the Great War were the result of shortages and shortcomings due to the outdated military industry. Proposed by our lawmakers, these policies seeks to impose new standards and regulations on our military industry to bolster production quotas. While meeting these standards will be costly in the short term, it'll allow us to improve our production in the long term."
UKR_weapons_production_lines: "Weapons Production Lines"
UKR_weapons_production_lines_desc: "More, more, and more - we will need more to build up our nation. We must increase our manufacturing processes while also streamlining our weapons production to new heights. One way or another, we will show the world the prowess of our nation!"

UKR_anti_air_and_anti_tank_desc: "Artillery has become more and more useful in warfare, so much so that many frontline battalions nowadays are exclusively based on punishing artillery fire. We should take note and go forth, examining the models utilised by our faithful allies in the North. Whatever we find out, we'll be able to combine with our own designs and models."

UKR_mountaineer_units_desc: "The Mountains that surround us are an integral part of any national defence plan in case of invasion. Passes, peaks and hillsides must not be garrisoned with fresh recruits, but with elite specially trained regiments who are ready for the harsh reality of mountain life."

Therefore, the planning committee has decided to spread out the manufactories and secure supply lines even in the worst situations."
UKR_science_of_war: "The Science of War"
UKR_science_of_war_desc: "As we march into the future, it becomes plainly obvious that new wars will rather be won using superior technology than any long-form trench warfare or “flood-wave” tactics. As such, we should establish an Army department tasked with staying on top of any new developments in Doctrinal or Technological enhancements."
# Navy
UKR_reinforce_crimea: "Reinforce Crimea"
UKR_reinforce_crimea_desc: "Crimea was always an important trade port for Ukraine, that's why we must be ready to defend this city with our Black Sea fleet. We should expand the harbour in Crimea."

UKR_submarines: "Submarines"
UKR_submarines_desc: "The submarine is vital to winning any war against a foe reliant upon trade. If their convoys are sunk, their men go without supplies - this will lead to an easy victory. We must ensure that the Black Sea acts for our enemies as little more than a dark watery grave."
UKR_black_sea_maneuvers: "Black Sea Maneuvers"
UKR_black_sea_maneuvers_desc: "Only a large fleet will suit Ukraine, as without one we won't be able to control the long coastlines of the Black and Azov Seas"
UKR_marine_training: "Marine Training"
UKR_marine_training_desc: "In order to stay on top in whatever war we may find ourselves in, we will need the navy to possess a significant number of standing divisions capable of amphibious landings. While this may be giving the navy too much power, it's bound to help both branches to be more effective in the battlefield."
UKR_carrier_prototypes: "Carrier Prototypes"
UKR_carrier_prototypes_desc: "Native dockyards in Odessa and Nikolayev are more than capable of producing large ships, such as carriers and battleships. These will prove priceless in nearly every naval engagement."

UKR_gomel_air_base: "Gomel Air Base"
UKR_gomel_air_base_desc: "Modern aircraft, pilots and mechanics are all nice, but are useless without the infrastructure needed to even operate the air force. Ukraine is large and will require many new air bases to allow the air force to operate properly and support land and naval operations."
UKR_purchase_german_naval_bombers: "Purchase German Naval Bombers"
UKR_purchase_german_naval_bombers_desc: "The air can well pair with the sea. Planes carrying torpedoes allow us to instantly kill even the biggest of ships with great accuracy, the torpedoes preventing us from having to hit dead centre on a ship's deck with a bomb. We must invest in naval bombers to gain an edge on big, bulky navies."
UKR_deploy_the_new_fighter_prototypes: "Deploy the New Fighter Prototypes"
UKR_deploy_the_new_fighter_prototypes_desc: "In recent years we've taken to developing our own Fighter designs, with some joint effort from our other allies. Our efforts have paid off, it seems. Testing has shown a very positive result. As such, we should deploy our newly developed aviation for mass production."
UKR_a_domestic_bomber_model: "A Domestic Bomber Model"
UKR_a_domestic_bomber_model_desc: "Bombers have been shown to be very effective in disabling various elements of the war machine of any given warring nation. Whenever the next major European war comes, and it will, we must be ready. Depending on the designs utilised by our suppliers (primarily Germany) is all well and good, but it isn't completely viable. As such, we must begin working on own designs."
UKR_strategic_bomber_prototype: "Strategic Bomber Prototype"
UKR_strategic_bomber_prototype_desc: "Bombing enemy production facilities and supply lines is a great way to stack the odds in our favour against better equipped and more numerous opponents. However, in order to do so, we must ensure that we have aircraft able to properly perform the tasks set aside for it."
UKR_enhance_our_aviation_doctrine: "Enhance Our Aviation Doctrine"
UKR_enhance_our_aviation_doctrine_desc: "Ever since the creation of our Air Force, it has greatly developed. In order to render it an equal military force to the army and navy, we must develop new aerial doctrines."

UKR_matters_of_the_economy: "Matters of the Economy"
UKR_matters_of_the_economy_desc: "While Ukraine's economy is not the weakest in the Eastern European region, it is also not the strongest.

UKR_modern_wheat_processing: "Modern Wheat Processing"
UKR_modern_wheat_processing_desc: "Outdated farming techniques causes us a significant amount of wasted output across our agricultural sector. Modernising how we process our crops will greatly improve both the yields and the quality of what our farms produce annually, which should go a long way in preventing any future shortages."

As part of the modernisation of the economy, many are calling for a focused expansion of electricity across our nation, so that no town will be left in the darkness."
UKR_subsidize_azovstal: "Subsidize Azovstal"
UKR_subsidize_azovstal_desc: "While it may sound redundantly obvious, it will be impossible to build an industrial region without the construction services to do so, as we are already finding companies struggling to meet the specifications of modern factories. Funding will be allocated for the expansion and modernisation of construction companies and their equipment. This effort should hopefully allow us to speed up the growth of our industrial capabilities."
UKR_kharkiv_weapons_factories: "Kharkiv Weapons Factories"
UKR_kharkiv_weapons_factories_desc: "Until now domestic weapons manufacturing in our nation has been practically non existent apart from artisanal hunting rifles.

UKR_farming_subsidies: "Farming Subsidies"
UKR_farming_subsidies_desc: "It is necessary to subsidise farms for crops we are in need of, and paying farmers to terminate their fields of lost assets for products like tobacco we don't need right now, but want the skilled labour to still be available."
UKR_urbanization_programs: "Urbanization Programs"
UKR_urbanization_programs_desc: "Many of our cities are old, and their infrastructure reflects this. A combination of age and underfunding has made our cities seem archaic, with many public services and housing either at their limits or crumbling. A series of ambitious plans have been drafted to completely revitalise Ukraine's urban areas and their services."
UKR_railway_improvements: "Railway Improvements"
UKR_railway_improvements_desc: "As part of our policy on state modernisation, we must expand the rail network in our predominantly agrarian nation.

UKR_odessa_state_university_desc: "Much of our rural population was never able to receive any form of education, and this has gone a long way to entrenching the economic divides and advancement problems in our nation. In a bid to remove the barriers many rural individuals experience due to their lack of education, we will intensify efforts to eliminate rural illiteracy across our nation. While it may prove costly, it is hoped that it will pay off in the long run."
UKR_new_industrial_areas: "New Industrial Areas"
UKR_new_industrial_areas_desc: "The most straightforward way to combat unemployment is to kickstart large public works projects the unemployed can participate in. They can then use the money they earn with this to take care of their families. As an added bonus, the money they spend will enter the economy and help it recover."
UKR_mining_grants: "Mining Grants"
UKR_mining_grants_desc: "Our nation's natural wealth remains mostly unsurveyed and unexploited. A state mining company should be established to finally survey what lies beneath our nation and put our natural resources fully to work."
UKR_economic_recovery: "Towards Economic Recovery"
UKR_economic_recovery_desc: "Social problems always provoke political instability. Lots of peasants join Socialist, nationalist or Russian separatist movements because of awful living conditions. If we want to save Ukraine from collapse, we should start a recovery programme and help the poorest grain-growers in Central Ukraine, providing our population with the cheap electricity they require. For this, we need cash."
UKR_economic_recovery_tt: "§GThis focus will be automatically be bypassed once the London Stock Market Crash has reached Ukraine.§!"

UKR_privatization_spree: "Privatization Spree"
