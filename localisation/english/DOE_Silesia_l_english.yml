 ### National Spirits ###
 SIL_idea_silesian_red_army: "The Silesian Red Army"
 SIL_idea_silesian_red_army_desc: "When it became clear that the damned Republic would fall, our revolutionary comrades came together in Silesia to finish what the revolutions after the Great War failed to. Acting in a timely manner was essential as it is clear that the reactionary Papen would never back down from power once he had it. Now, the Red Army is made up of volunteers from all over Germany and beyond. Although mistakes have and likely will continued to be made, no amount of supposed professionalism can trump the revolutionary spirit!"
 SIL_idea_spartacist_suspicion: "Lessons of the Great Betrayal"
 SIL_idea_spartacist_suspicion_desc: "When we were poised to overthrow the decrepit Empire, our hopes of victorious revolution was dashed by a cursed alliance of inept moderates, greedy capitalists and bitter reactionaries. Despite our stinging defeat at the hands of the old order however, the revolution lived on. Now however, empty promises and false pleas will not stop proletarian wrath from totally destroying the capitalists and their reactionary allies."
 SIL_idea_all_out_struggle: "Ready to Fight"
 SIL_idea_all_out_struggle_desc: "Following our takeover of Silesia, we have prepared ourselves for the oncoming reactionary onslaught. With the entire economy in the grasp of our hands, we can now ensure that all materials go towards the victory of the people. That said, we cannot afford to sit around and wait for the revolution to come to Berlin. Should we wait too long, we can expect that the people will be none too pleased with the measures we have taken to protect the proletariat."
