ENG_FUHRERREDUX_DESC: "The Great War lasted for five long years of merciless slaughter and destruction. In the end, Britain stood victorious over the butchered Central Powers, establishing itself once more as the global hegemon. The 1931 Statute of Autonomy would grant the Dominion nations only limited powers, with the original proposals being drastically altered resulting in great resentment towards the mother country. Britain is in a precarious position. The Imperial Conference of 1937 looms ever closer and in the years that follow Britain will be faced with choices that will not only determine the fate of the Empire, but of the future of Britain itself."

### Leader Descriptions
POLITICS_ENG_GEORGE_V_DESC: "George V of Windsor is the King-Emperor of the British Empire, more than just in name. Reigning nearly 3 times longer than his father, Edward VII, he has risen to become one of the most beloved Monarchs in British history. Under his reign the British Empire has once again asserted itself as the Global Hegemon and has economically eclipsed both their rivals and former allies following the Empire's return to Splendid Isolation. However, his invincible image does not entirely live up to reality. As the years march forward, King George's health has been steadily deteriorating, forcing him allow his son, Prince Edward, to assume a portion of his duties. Some of the Empire's finest medical experts expect him to live another 10 years at minimum, although King George privately holds an opinion to the contrary, despite his often stoic nature."
POLITICS_ENG_EDWARD_VIII_DESC: "With the passing of the beloved King George, Edward VIII of Windsor found himself inheriting not only an Empire spanning from Vancouver to Wellington, but also the larger-than-life image that was established by his Father. Charismatic, confident, and armed with experience from the closing years of his Father's reign; the newly coronated King-Emperor is prepared to assume any duties that may be required of him in coming years."

# - Tory Maj
ENG_con_maj: "Conservative Majority"
ENG_con_maj_desc: "The Tories have won their third election in a row, but this time things are different, they now have a clear majority in parliament. Perhaps now without needing to compromise with other parties their traditional values can steer the Empire as it was meant to be."
ENG_fund_royal_society: "Fund Royal Society"
ENG_fund_royal_society_desc: "The Royal Society is a group of the finest British minds we have available. Giving them funding and turning them towards the problems we face, and the reconstruction of British society, will be an ideal use of their knowledge and skills."
ENG_five_eyes_programme: "Five Eyes Programme"
ENG_five_eyes_programme_desc: "Each member of our Empire has its own espionage programme, but what if the alliance worked together? Rather than wasting effort spying on each other, what if they cooperated and instead spent that effort focused on our enemies?"
ENG_royal_charter_companies: "Royal Charter Companies"
ENG_royal_charter_companies_desc: "The British nobility has some cash reserves we can use for the economy. It's time to put that money to good use, and start a series of high-profile corporations - which, while still technically part of the private sector, would be regulated heavily by the government as Royal Charters. This should boost the economy considerably"
ENG_tory_nation: "Conservative Nation"
ENG_tory_nation_desc: "Our values, our traditions, our time-honoured way of life have become an inspiration to British people across the Empire. In the midst of turmoil from the crash and the revivalist Threat on the continent our people look up to the flag; and keep calm and carry on."

ENG_court_corp: "Court the Corporations"
ENG_court_corp_desc: "With our new Government in place it is time to reach out to the numerous important businessmen across our nation. The Government is open for business, and now so is Britain."
ENG_fund_mi6: "Fund MI6"
ENG_fund_mi6_desc: "MI6 has always been His Majesty's foreign intelligence service. Many of its directors went into exile along with the king, and now the time has come to rebuild it and start the process of putting the British back at the forefront of international intelligence."
# - Tory+LibNats Coalition

ENG_tory_coalition: "Conservative-Liberal Coalition"
ENG_tory_coalition_desc: "The winds of politics are ever changing, and it seems we have seen the next one. While the Tories saw a strong turn out we didn’t quite have the overwhelming support we had hoped for, and a fair number of Liberal-Nationals won seats along side them. In order to hold a majority of parliament a coalition was formed between our two parties to ensure stability."
ENG_unify_gov: "Unifying the Government"
ENG_unify_gov_desc: "With the party unified and the Tories firmly in charge it’s time to show our new united front to Parliament. The opposition can talk all they want but in the end the decisions that affect this nation are going to be decided by our coalition."
ENG_rely_foreign_investment: "Rely on Foreign Investment"
ENG_rely_foreign_investment_desc: ""
ENG_national_arms_deal: "National Arms Deal"
ENG_national_arms_deal_desc: "Our military is going to have to grow a great deal - not to mention the fact we'll need to supply police forces across the country. This means we'll need to sign a contract with at least one major national arms dealer"

ENG_bbc: "Utilize the BBC"
ENG_bbc_desc: "The British Broadcasting Corporation has been turned into a wreck by the previous administration. It's time to restore it to greatness and cut it free from the leash it's been on for the last two decades."
ENG_imperial_chemical: "Imperial Chemical Deal"
ENG_imperial_chemical_desc: "To put it bluntly, the United Kingdom needs fuel, and we will need to employ our contacts in the private sector to set up our future as a fuel producer rather than solely an importer"
# - Labour+ILP Coalition
ENG_socialist_coalition: "The Socialist Coalition"
ENG_socialist_coalition_desc: "Change has come to Great Britain, for the first time since its creation in 1900, the Labour party has managed to win a majority in Parliament. These socialist plans of Labour and the ILP may be what Britain needs to secure her future."
ENG_united_socialist: "United Socialist Front"
ENG_united_socialist_desc: "With the integration of the ILP's MPs into our party our hold on the Government is stronger than ever before. We have succeeded what many thought impossible; creating a united socialist front against the unprogressive elements of our nations politics."
ENG_regulate_industrial_growth: "Regulate Industrial Growth"
ENG_regulate_industrial_growth_desc: "If we're not careful, there are too many 'entrepreneurs' who will use the current state of the British economy as a way to gain power or exploit the British people. We must be wary and regulate the regrowth of industry carefully, while making efforts not to overly restrict it and thus slow it down."
ENG_public_works: "Public Works"
ENG_public_works_desc: "In Britain, you rule by opening roads. And other pieces of infrastructure, things that the people can see and touch; it's a natural product of the years of empty promises faced by the people. If we want to hope for re-election, we need a magnum opus."
ENG_small_business_subsidies: "Small Business Subsidies"
ENG_small_business_subsidies_desc: "We can help set the economy back on course by supporting local businesses over large British corporations. This will ensure prosperity and employment for the natives, and help dissuade them from voting somebody else."

ENG_absolutism: "God Save The King!"
ENG_absolutism_desc: "In the wake of great civil unrest across the nation His Royal Highness Edward VIII has dissolved parliament and taken the reigns of the Empire's future into his own hands. For the first time since the Reform Act in 1832 the King rules his country."
ENG_fate_unions: "Fate of the Trade Unions"
ENG_fate_unions_desc: "An integral part of the Manchester Workers Crisis, the Trade Unions have finally crossed the line with their formenting of this revolution. The time has arrived for us to decide once and for all what will become of these insiduous organisations."
ENG_aristocracy: "Role of the Aristocracy"
ENG_aristocracy_desc: "Many of the King's greatest supporters in his intervention to save our nation from destruction came from the aristocracy of our nation. While their titles are largely ceremonial, perhaps it is time for a change to ensure our control over the Kingdom."
ENG_faith_nation: "Faith in our Nation"
ENG_faith_nation_desc: "Nominally a bulwark against radicalism, the Church of England has been a staunch supporter of our King in his quest to crush radicalism across the nation and impose order and justice. While some believe that the Church is an antiquated institition, there is much to be gained from an alliance."
ENG_household_guard: "The Household Guard"
ENG_household_guard_desc: "Established as an elite bodyguard for the Monarchy, the Household Guard played a prominent role in securing power over the faltering democratic Government which preceeded us. Questions have been raised as to what their true role should be in the coming years."
ENG_expand_privy: "Expand the Privy Council"
ENG_expand_privy_desc: "Created to act as an advisory body for the Monarchy, the Privy Council has in recent years simply been filled to the brim with sycophantic politicians. The time has come for a change in its composition."
ENG_destiny: "Our Path and Destiny"
ENG_destiny_desc: "Providence has guided the King to this day, his actions in the Manchester Workers Crisis have proven correct. Stability and Peace and have returned to our fair Isles, and our rule is secure. Now a final question remains: Where does Britain's destiny lie?"

# - Jack's Dictatorship

ENG_junta: "The Military Junta"
ENG_junta_desc: "''Fire!'' The order went down the line and rioters fell before the British military. As the socialists ran one man gave a stirring speech. Colonel Jack Churchill rose an antique broadsword in the air decrying the politicians that forced him and his men to kill British peoples on British soil. Never again would they allow those above to force action against the British people. There would be only one way to ensure this."
ENG_establish_barb: "Establish the BARB"
ENG_establish_barb_desc: "The streets whisper rebellion, radicalism hides in the shadows everywhere. To root out these insidious and grave threats to our nation a new organisation must be set up to destroy threats wherever they may be found."
ENG_purge_opposition: "The Purge"
ENG_purge_opposition_desc: "Churchill's voice roared through the halls of Westminster as the Trials began. The Prime Minister and several other prominent members of Parliament were dragged before a military tribunal and quickly found guilty of high treason and complicitity in the murder of several hundred British citizens. Their hanging would be scheduled for dawn on the morrow."
ENG_soldier_education: "A Soldier's Education"
ENG_soldier_education_desc: "Lying at the root of the tides of revolution which attempted to overthrow the Government is the educational system of Britain. Perhaps the time has arrived to create a new patriotic educational system."
ENG_royal_army_reforms: "British Army Reforms"
ENG_royal_army_reforms_desc: "While some regard Churchill's views on the British Army as quaint, his will to change overcomes this gossip with ease. Placing an importance on the infantryman in combat, power must be handed back to the ideal soldier and the symbol of this power will remain the military sabre."
ENG_mil_ind_complex: "Begin Plan J"
ENG_mil_ind_complex_desc: "Created by previous Governments in case of war, Plan J orders the rapid mobilisation of the British economy for war-time. While upsetting to some initiating Plan J far in advance of war will ensure we are far more prepared for conflict than other nations."
ENG_future_britain: "The Future of Britain"
ENG_future_britain_desc: "Through Churchill's guiding hand stability has returned to Britain, and peace reigns once more. In these challenging times our future has diverged, what path must Britain take to ensure her superiority?"
ENG_dictatorship: "The Lord Protector"
ENG_dictatorship_desc: "With Parliament cleansed of unwanted elements and Churchill's rule secure, he has taken the title of Lord Protector of the Realm with the blessing of the King himself. Treasonous politicians will no longer grow fat off the backs of the British people - Churchill will make sure of that."

# - Mosley as Premier

ENG_england_lives: "England Lives!"

ENG_subjugate_labour: "Subjugating Labour"
ENG_subjugate_labour_desc: "Our wayward cousins need to be shown the true path to socialism and peace in our land. Labour must be brought around to our way of thinking, something that can be easily accomplished by influencing some of their key members."
ENG_overcome_lords: "Overcoming the Lords"
ENG_overcome_lords_desc: "An outdated institution for sure, and one which stands in the way of implementing our new policies across Britain. The House of Lords must be reformed if we are to succeed in this new age, the only question is how they should be dealt with."
ENG_meet_mil: "Meeting with the Military"
ENG_meet_mil_desc: "Since we claimed our rightful position as leaders of this country there have been whispers of dissent among the ranks of the military. In order to assuage these wayward sheep, Mosley has invited them to Parliament so that they may discuss the future of Britain."
ENG_national_program: "Nationalisation Program"
ENG_national_program_desc: "One of the key economic policies of Mosley's Economic Plan is to nationalise several important industries across the Empire. These new industries will be placed under Government control to ensure they work in the best interests of the British people."
ENG_brit_spirit: "The Good Old British Spirit"
ENG_brit_spirit_desc: "The Britain of Tomorrow must also be one of the Past. There are many great and admirable qualities that the British people harbour, but in recent years they have been influenced by foreign meddling and interference. Britain's spirit must be awakened, and once more the world shall tremble at her approach."
ENG_marches_on: "And Marches On!"
ENG_marches_on_desc: "The Light of Britain shines brightly once more, the guiding light to lead Mankind to its destiny. We will illuminate the path for all other nations to follow, a path of tomorrow, a path to socialism."

ENG_navy_state: "Navy with a State"
ENG_navy_state_desc: "With Eden in power and him in agreement with the high-ranking officers of the Royal Navy, Britain is once more secure from efforts to leave her defenceless against foreign powers."

ENG_cement_rule: "Cementing our Rule"
ENG_cement_rule_desc: "Even though Eden directs the Government to act in the interests of the Royal Navy - and of course the Empire - there are still many who would oppose our own efforts to do so, and since we are still ostensibly a democracy efforts must be made to quell these dissenters."
ENG_naval_lords: "Naval Lords"
ENG_naval_lords_desc: "Though the power of the House of Lords was diminished somewhat since the beginning of this century, it still holds great influence over many quarters of soceity. By granting lordships to many of our close associates in the Royal Navy we can extend our influence further."
ENG_custodians: "Custodians of the Crown"
ENG_custodians_desc: "The Royal Navy is the first line of defence of the Empire, and thus of the Monarchy itself. While the prestige may be held by the Household Guard, the public knows that it is we who determine whether or not the Empire survives from foreign aggression."
ENG_defender_demo: "Defenders of Democracy"
ENG_defender_demo_desc: "The Royal Navy has in the past acted as the instrument of Government to impose political settlements on foreign nations, such as those slaving in the Atlantic and South Indian Ocean. Today the Royal Navy stands prepared to defend democracy around the world from authoritarianism."

ENG_repeal_naval_cuts: "Repeal Naval Cuts"
ENG_repeal_naval_cuts_desc: "The first act of our Government should be the repeal of those disastrous naval cuts which led to the Mutiny at Invergordon. Only by doing this can we bring the Royal Navy to heights previously unseen and unheard of."
ENG_navy_guns: "Guns of the Navy"
ENG_navy_guns_desc: "The Big Guns of the Navy are the weapons we will use to bring judgement upon our foes, and thus must remain modern and without competition."
ENG_first_rate_industry: "A First Rate Industry"
ENG_first_rate_industry_desc: "With the United States quickly outpacing our nation industrially we must make efforts to lay the groundwork for further industry used to support our Navy and the Government's efforts to expand it further."

ENG_navy_armour_desc: "With larger and more powerful weapons being developed both in the Empire and in the homes of our enemies, armour design has to be maintained and modernised further if we are to withstand the blows our foes lay upon us."
ENG_naval_impressment: "Naval Impressment"
ENG_naval_impressment_desc: "Though Naval Impressment ended with the end of Napoleon at the start of the 19thC, the wars we may find ourselves embroiled in the near future may require these emergency measures to once more take place. Though this will undoubtedly harm relations between ourselves and foreign powers."

ENG_tempest: "Tempest Program"
ENG_tempest_desc: "Codenamed Tempest, this naval program aims to reinforce our position on the Seven Seas by construction an additional four Battleships of a modern variety."
ENG_eclipse_rivals: "Eclipse our Rivals"
ENG_eclipse_rivals_desc: "Further pursuing efforts to dominate the oceans of the world, the Royal Navy has requested the construction of two additional Carriers to assist in power projection across the globe."
ENG_steel_shield: "The Steel Shield"

ENG_tighten_grip: "Tighten our Grip"
ENG_tighten_grip_desc: "Though our Navy is one of the largest the world has ever seen, it requires regular modernisation programs to maintain its position. In particular, light cruisers are of particular interest to the Royal Navy to ensure we are never short of vessels."

ENG_sword_shield: "Our Sword and Shield"
ENG_sword_shield_desc: "The Royal Navy is both the sword through which we strike our foes and the shield through which we guard from their blows. Without it, the Empire would be defenceless and its fall would be an inevitability."

#####Colonial Unrest#####

ENG_colonial_uprising: "Colonial Uprising"
ENG_colonial_uprising_desc: "The lingering unrest across our East African colonies has sprung into an armed insurgency with the intention of gaining independence. In order to ensure the stability of the Empire the revolt must be put down, and quickly."
ENG_boost_forces: "Increase Local Garrisons"
ENG_boost_forces_desc: "Increasing local garrisons in the areas worst affected will not only impose order on these volatile areas but also be a significant show of strength that Britain still rules her Empire."
ENG_work_loyal: "Work With Loyalist Elements"
ENG_work_loyal_desc: "Despite the existence of some misguided individuals seeking independence for their nation, there remains those loyal to the Empire across East Africa. By establishing strong ties with these individuals we can help to dissuade further people from joining the rebel cause."
ENG_impose_rule: "Impose British Rule"
ENG_impose_rule_desc: "With the rebel insurgency relatively disorganised it should take little effort to put them down. All we need is time."


#####Ireland#####
ENG_controls_irish_states: "Controls all states in the §Yemerald isle§!."
ENG_ire_homerule: "Irish Home Rule"
ENG_ire_homerule_desc: "Granted in the aftermath of the Great War, Irish Home Rule has helped to alleviate tensions caused by the Easter Rising in 1916. Since then with the IRB operating in the shadows, some now believe the time has come to grant Ireland either additional autonomy or to ensure it remains an integral part of the United Kingdom."
ENG_ire_homerule_tt: "§GThis focus will be automatically be bypassed once we have decided Ireland's future in the Imperial Conference.§!"
ENG_towards_integration: "Towards Integration"
ENG_towards_integration_desc: "With Government policy now set on creating the case for Ireland to maintain the status quo within the Union, we must reform and pursue new policies with the Irish people."
ENG_towards_independence: "Towards Independence"
ENG_towards_independence_desc: "One thing has become clear, only with Ireland's independence will we be free of the IRB scourge upon our nation. Only now we must nurture the institutions to ready independence for Ireland."
ENG_expand_control: "Expand Political Control"
ENG_expand_control_desc: "Many areas of Ireland are still ruled poorly and loosely by several British citizens more concerned with making wealth than helping locals. To ensure Ireland is happy with the current arrangement we must stamp out these profiteers and ensure proper control."
ENG_ire_invest: "Invest in Rural Ireland"
ENG_ire_invest_desc: "Perhaps one of the poorest areas of the United Kingdom, rural Ireland needs investment to link it fully with the rest of the country and ensure the rule of law can extend to the countryside as well. To make things better, this will also assist in the RICs ability to counter the IRB."
ENG_ire_endreligdiscr: "End Policies of Religious Discrimination"
ENG_ire_endreligdiscr_desc: "In many ways a relic from a bygone era, policies of religious discrimination against Catholics abound across the Irish isles. In order to ensure that all of Ireland is content with our rule we cannot play favouritism. Unfortunately this is likely to upset our supporters in the North of the country."
ENG_ire_reinforce_constab: "Reinforce Irish Constabulary"
ENG_ire_reinforce_constab_desc: "The RIC is struggling to police the entirety of Ireland, and its numbers continue to dwindle from IRB attacks. To ensure that Ireland remains stable we must bring in extra reinforcements for the RIC from other parts of the United Kingdom in preparation for solving the IRB problem."

ENG_crush_brotherhood: "Crush the Brotherhood"
ENG_crush_brotherhood_desc: "The time has arrived for the Irish Republican Brotherhood to be dealt with swiftly. Ireland stands at a precipice, our choices in the coming weeks will determine the fate of Ireland and the United Kingdom as a whole."
ENG_ire_discussion: "Encourage Irish Political Discussion"
ENG_ire_discussion_desc: "Since the Great War Ireland there has been a growing minority within the country that are content with the status quo. Engaging this group in Irish political discussions is crucial in creating the correct atmosphere for independence in Ireland."
ENG_ire_create_parliament: "Create an Irish Parliament"
ENG_ire_create_parliament_desc: "While Parliament House in Dublin has existed since 1729, the creation of a formal Parliament requires more than a building to house Irish MPs. By beginning the slow transfer of additional power to the Irish Parliament it will at last become a fully functioning parliament with the ability to govern without British interference."
ENG_ire_united: "A United Ireland"
ENG_ire_united_desc: "Since Ireland's formal integration into the United Kingdom in 1800, all of the island of Ireland has been considered a single political identity, at least until the threat of Home Rule became apparent. Regardless of those agitating for a 'special relationship' with the United Kingdom Ireland must be a united political entity upon independence."
ENG_ire_divided: "Protect the Ulster-Scots"
ENG_ire_divided_desc: "Since Home Rule was proposed in the late 19thC there has emerged an extremely loyal, and sometime radical, force within the North of Ireland. These Unionists are largely descendant of the Ulster Plantations and are unquestionably loyal to the United Kingdom. We cannot abandon these people."
ENG_ire_pass_homerule: "Pass the Home Rule Bill"
ENG_ire_pass_homerule_desc: "Successive Home Rule acts were passed in the years surrounding the Great War, with the final Fourth Home Rule Act being passed in 1920 which established a greater deal of autonomy for Ireland within the United Kingdom, though without some of the demands made by the Irish Parliamentary Party. Today we stand on the brink of passing the Fifth, and final, Home Rule Act, fulfilling previous promises of total independence for Ireland."

#####Imperial Future#####

ENG_statute_westminster: "The Statute of Westminster"
ENG_statute_westminster_desc: "Proposed in the Imperial Conferences of 1917-18 but never passed, the Statute of Westminster would be re-branded as the Statute of Autonomy after being picked apart in the House of Commons. Today the Statute of Westminster is yet to be fully realised, but many in the Dominions still hope that it can."

ENG_imp_fed: "An Imperial Federation"
ENG_imp_fed_desc: "Proposed at the turn of the century, the idea of an Imperial Federation survived the Great War, but only barely. Proposed as an alternative to an ever decentralised Empire, the Imperial Federation has only in recent years become attractive as a political idea due to advances in technology and communication."
ENG_ris: "The Royal Imperial Society"
ENG_ris_desc: "Intellectuals from across the Empire meet regularly in London for conferences on new technological developments, but through the other days of the eyar remain relatively separated. To ensure research continues unabated across the Empire we can established a new society to foster technoligical development."
ENG_sup_loyal: "Support Overseas Loyalists"
ENG_sup_loyal_desc: "With our decision to pursue an Imperial Federation many of those living in the Dominions have been angered greatly by this new proposal. In order to solidify the case for the Imperial Federation we must work closely with, and support those loyalists to the Empire who live overseas."
ENG_rej_imp_conf: "Rejuvenate the Imperial Conferences"
ENG_rej_imp_conf_desc: "If the Imperial Federation is to be successful we must step up efforts to communciate with the Dominion representatives. Rejuvenating the Imperial Conferences - that have recently only been held once every 4 years - would be a step in the right direction to ensure cooperation between the Empire."
ENG_imp_parl: "Construct an Imperial Parliament"
ENG_imp_parl_desc: "Created to house the Imperial Representatives across the Empire, each Dominion will create their own Imperial Parliament which will convene once every three months to discuss Imperial affairs."
ENG_dom_integ: "Dominion Parliament Integration"
ENG_dom_integ_desc: "With the Imperial Parliament constructed the time has arrived to formally convert existing Members of Parliament of the Dominion nations and the British Isles to Members of the Imperial Parliament. Ostensibly a ceremonial affair, it will signal that the Imperial Federation is quickly becoming a reality."
ENG_common_eco: "Common Economic Policy"
ENG_common_eco_desc: "Imperial economics have in recent years seen its power undermined by Dominion Governments unwilling to cooperate with the rest of the Empire for the sake of unity. Only through merging our economic efforts once more will Imperial economic power be brought to bare on the world."
ENG_imp_command: "Imperial Military Command"
ENG_imp_command_desc: "Perhaps one of the most divisive issues of the Great War was the deaths of hundreds of thousands of Dominion troops at the hands of British military leaders. This hurdle cannot be overcome easily, and to ensure that each Dominion has a say in military matters may weaken us politically, it will ensure Dominion loyalty in the long term."
ENG_diss_parl: "Reorganise Dominion Parliaments"
ENG_diss_parl_desc: "After years of painstaking work and effort, the time has finally arrived to reorganise the Dominion Parliaments and officially merge them into the Imperial Parliament. Up until this point the Dominions may have been happy to allow the Imperial Federation to play out, but if our relations our poor then this final effort may spur on rebellion across the Empire."

ENG_status_quo: "Status Quo"
ENG_status_quo_desc: "Reforming the Empire will only lead to disaster, if we are to survive we must maintain what we have today and ensure its stability in the decades to come. The Dominions may resist our efforts, but they will learn as all others do - that they will ultimately bow to Britain."
ENG_bonds: "Strengthen the Bonds"
ENG_bonds_desc: "Weakened due to the horrific casualties suffered in the Great War, the bonds that bind the Empire need to be strengthened if we are to create a united front against our foes and remain a bulwark of stability in this fractious world."
ENG_empire_unity: "An Empire of Unity"
ENG_empire_unity_desc: "With stability ensured across the Empire and those conspiring reformers prevented from gaining power, we have created a new image of the Empire to show to the world. We are no longer an Empire divided, but an Empire of Unity."
ENG_promote_trade: "Promote Imperial Trade"
ENG_promote_trade_desc: "To ensure continued economic development within the Empire and reliance upon ourselves, and only ourselves, we must promote trade between ourselves and the Dominions."
ENG_mil_coord: "Imperial Military Co-Ordination"
ENG_mil_coord_desc: "While directly integrating military leadership does not seem terribly feasible, there is nothing stopping us from actively cooperating with the Dominions who have in recent years strengthened their military so that in many ways it is comparable to our own."
ENG_imp_science: "Imperial Science"
ENG_imp_science_desc: "Efforts to continue research into new and exciting fields will only benefit greatly from a continued cooperation of Empire-wide science facilities. Rather than investing independently on new areas of research, we can work together and gain a greater lead over others than ever before."

ENG_decentralise: "Freedom for the Dominions"
ENG_decentralise_desc: "The Wind of Change is blowing across the Empire. Whether or not we like it, this growth of national conciousness across the Empire and its Dominions cannot be sated. Only by continuing efforts to increase autonomy and decentralise power to the Dominions will we prevent calamity."
ENG_red_gg: "Reduce Power of the Governor-Generals"
ENG_red_gg_desc: "Holding tremendous power over our Dominions, the Governor-Generals have in recent years used their power sparingly but have still become a source of controversy in the Dominion nations, being viewed as nothing more than an extension of our power over them."
ENG_autono_fp: "Autonomous Foreign Policy"
ENG_autono_fp_desc: "While a terrribly frightening idea to some, the Dominions cannot be granted total freedom unless they have the liberty to decide their own foreign policy regarding global affairs. While this may weaken or Empire's resolve in the long run, it will perhaps in the short term make us stronger."
ENG_estab_con: "The Commonwealth of Nations"
ENG_estab_con_desc: "While the end of the Empire in many ways seems near, we do not need to end cooperation between ourselves and our Dominion friends. By establishing the Commonwealth of Nations, an organisation where each participant holds equal power then we may ensure a modicum of unity between ourselves and the Dominions."
ENG_affirm_sow: "Affirm the Statute of Westminster"
ENG_affirm_sow_desc: "With the Dominions having been granted far greater autonomy over the past several years than many though possible, it seems as if passing the Statute of Westminster is a purely ceremonial affair. Though it will show to the Dominion populations that while in 1931 the British Government made a mistake, that she would in recent times be willing to rectify it."

#####Military Focuses#####

ENG_mil_review: "Royal Military Review"
ENG_mil_review_desc: "It has been almost two decades since the end of the Great War and there are some in the upper echelons of the Government who worry the military is suffering from severe atrophy. With this in mind the Government is prepared to order an immediate review of the Armed Forces."

# - Army

ENG_recon_army: "Reconstitute the British Army"
ENG_recon_army_desc: "Suffering severely since the end of the Great War, the British Army is perhaps one of the worst effected areas of our military cut-backs. Severely under-equipped and still utilising out-dated equipment, the British Army has been found wanting, and we must ensure they are properly managed."

ENG_massingberd: "Massingberd's Mobile Divisions"
ENG_massingberd_desc: "Sir Archibald Massingberd has made it very clear that he believes the best way to win a war is to push the enemy hard, fast and from multiple angles. As such he is promoting the establishment of the first ever mobile and mechanized divisions for the British Army."
ENG_moto_efforts: "Motorisation Efforts"
ENG_moto_efforts_desc: "The first step in the creation of a more mobile army is to design vehicles that can carry our men wherever they need to go. Whether that be through the mud of Flanders, the jungles of central Africa or the deserts of the Near East."
ENG_lighttanks: "Light Tank Development"
ENG_lighttanks_desc: "During the Great War our army employed huge landships as a means of covering infantry advances. With a few modifications we could perhaps shrink these down to increase their speed. This will come at the cost of firepower and armour, but it will allow them to support our mobile regiments or our maneuver enemy forces."
ENG_introcruisers: "Introduce the Cruisers"
ENG_introcruisers_desc: "Our mobile divisions, while fast, do not have the stopping power required even with light armour support to breakthrough enemy defences. It is time to bring forth the newest in military innovation. Cruiser's are a halfway point between the light Matilda’s and the old landships. Packing enough firepower to push forward but move swiftly enough that they can bring up the rear of mobile divisions."
ENG_deploy_ra: "Deploy the Royal Armoured"
ENG_deploy_ra_desc: "Massingberd’s dream has finally come true. With the implementation of the Cruisers we now have tanks which can fight and hold their own against the opposition whether they employ armour, artillery or infantry. With these new Cruisers our new military philosophy Massingberd has unveiled the first ever completely armoured divisions of the British Army during a parade in London city."

ENG_ironside: "Ironside's Artillery"
ENG_ironside_desc: "Sir Edmund Ironside, having served in the fields both during the Boer War and the Great War, has argued vehemently that the lives of every British soldier should be of paramount importance to us. As such he has been calling for a greater focus on the Royal Artillery. After all, why risk the lives of brave men when we can simply shell our enemy into oblivion."
ENG_expand_ra: "Expand the Royal Artillery"
ENG_expand_ra_desc: "The first step in the remodeling of the Army to fit Ironside’s view is to expand the Royal Artillery. While this arm of the British Army has traditionally been used to support the infantry on their assaults, the trenches of the Somme and Ypres have taught us that if used properly they can form the core of a battle plan just as well."
ENG_incorp_aa: "Incorporate Anti-Air Equipment"
ENG_incorp_aa_desc: "Artillery can play a much more diverse role than any other piece of equipment on the battlefield. With their massive range and the size of their shell they have been proven to take even the largest planes out of the sky. If we make more mobile versions of these and add them to the Royal Artillery we will have aerial protection for our infantry as well."
ENG_art_produ1: "Standardise Production Methods"
ENG_art_produ1_desc: "Originally artillery has been produced in several factories across our nation, and despite strict production standards there are times when artillery has often differed significantly in its production value. By establishing factories designed to create specific parts of artillery equipment and enforcing stricter standards we can hopefully improve our ability to produce artillery."
ENG_art_produ2: "Artillery-Specialised Factories"
ENG_art_produ2_desc: "We need to build more guns if we are to continue to fuel the Royal Artillery's needs, but even with a standardised production we can’t produce them anywhere near fast enough. The best way to help with this is to select certain factories across the countries and ensure they have specialised equipment and designs to continue building up our stockpile of artillery undeterred."

ENG_haig: "Haig's Legacy"
ENG_haig_desc: "Sir Douglas Haig more commonly known as “The Butcher of The Somme” had a fearsome reputation both to our enemies and our own troops. Known for designing plans that would end in the death of thousands of men both our own and our foes. While his victories were costly, his impeccable planning meant that even battles that seemed like defeats were turned into greater victories on a larger scale."
ENG_battleplan: "Grand Battleplans"
ENG_battleplan_desc: "Every battle, every engagement, every march much serve a purpose in the greater plan for victory. The farther ahead we plan our battles the more likely we are to achieve greater victories as we push forward. A loss in one area if expected and planned could lead to a greater victory in another."
ENG_supporttanks: "Infantry Support Tanks"
ENG_supporttanks_desc: "Infantry can not win battles on their own, especially not when facing heavy armour or fortified positions. If we develop new types of armour to support our troops acting as both as cover and mobile gun emplacements we should be able to push up to and hopefully through enemy lines."
ENG_entrenchment: "Entrenchment Experience"
ENG_entrenchment_desc: "We have learned many lessons from the Great War. Mainly in the creation, assault and defence of trenches and other fortifications. If we apply our new planning theories to these old lessons we should be able to create more effectual defences and fortifications on our front lines."
ENG_landship: "The Land Battleship"
ENG_landship_desc: "Battleships have been the corner stone of our navy since their inception and their philosophy of massive blocks of metal and firepower have served us well at sea. Why can’t we apply this to our armour? With massive tanks covering our advances and retreats we will be able to move troops in a much safer a manner."

ENG_rmarines: "Royal Marines"
ENG_rmarines_desc: "The Royal Marines have been a regiment of the Royal Military for almost three hundred years, but until now they have been under the purview of the Royal Navy. However, a request has been made to establish the Royal Marines as independent of both the Army and Navy. This newfound autonomy will allow us to plan a greater number of naval invasion and with greater success."
ENG_rparas: "Royal Paratroopers"
ENG_rparas_desc: "Planes have become a part of our military more and more in recent years. They can penetrate deep behind enemy lines which means if we can deliver them to the ground safely we will be able to have specialised elite troops far behind the enemy defences to both waylay their supplies and take key positions while regular armed forces push in at the front."
ENG_renew_mil: "Renew Interest in the British Army"
ENG_renew_mil_desc: "Ever since the Great War fewer and fewer young men have been volunteering to join the British Army. Whether that was caused by the immense casualty rates, the perceived peace or just the changing idea of war does not matter. We need to reimagine and revitalise the image of the Black Watch, the Highlanders and the Grenadiers in order to attract new men to our armed forces."

# - RAF

ENG_theraf: "The Royal Air Force"
ENG_theraf_desc: "The face of the battlefield is changing. More and more frequently during the Great War we saw aircraft take to the skies in combat roles and at the end of the last war we created the RAF: the first independent airforce in the world. But as times change and technology advances we need to continue forward if we are to keep ahead of our competitors both technologically and tactically."

ENG_harris: "Harris' Bombers"
ENG_harris_desc: "Sir Arthur Harris has been arguing for several years now that small single or two-man planes are not what will win us wars in the future nor can they protect British shores. That to win we must have the ability to strike our enemies heartland and cripple him beyond repair."
ENG_strat_destruct: "Strategic Destruction"
ENG_strat_destruct_desc: "Controlling our own skies serves a purpose but it will not win us a war the only way to win a war is to strike at your opponent and crush them. As such, our leaders have developed plans and tactics that focus on using our multi-engine bombers to drop massive payloads over enemy industrial and military targets."
ENG_lrange_escorts: "Long Range Fighter Escorts"
ENG_lrange_escorts_desc: "Our bombers do the job; every time they cross the Channel they pound enemy regions into dust. However, of late our foe’s response time has increased, resulting in more of our bombers being shot down. If we are to continue with our bombing runs we must develop fighter planes that have a similar range to that of our bombers if we want to reduce our losses and ensure we continue striking our enemies."
ENG_future_invest: "Investing in the Future"
ENG_future_invest_desc: "The future of aviation and aerial warfare comes in the form of multi-engine planes, their range, their payload, their firepower, all are superior to other forms of aeronautic machines. Our government needs to invest in companies like Avro and Lancaster in order to ensure we have a stead flow of these powerful machines."

ENG_ccommand: "RAF Coastal Command"
ENG_ccommand_desc: "While the Royal Navy can protect us for naval incursion the RAF could play a significant role in that as well. By developing planes specifically designed to attack naval vessels and ports while also stationing RAF command posts near and on our coasts, we could greatly aid in protecting our home and expanding our power abroad."
ENG_assist_rn: "Assisting the Royal Navy"
ENG_assist_rn_desc: "The Royal Navy has always been the preeminent power of the Royal Military, but against attacks from the air it must rely on Heavy Cruisers equipped with Anti-Air canons to protect itself. Our researchers could however begin development on new Naval Bombers to assist in the destruction of enemy naval power."
ENG_defend_coast: "Defending our Coastline"
ENG_defend_coast_desc: "The British Isles are well defended from both naval and amphibious assault, the only glaring weakness in our defences is if we are attacked from the skies. While the RAF is a powerful defensive force it cannot be everywhere at once and does take time to scramble in the events of a raid. The danger of this could be mitigated if we were to construct some anti-aircraft emplacements along our coasts."

ENG_portal: "Portal's Ground Support Aircraft"
ENG_portal_desc: "Sir Charles Portal has always been of the impression that the greatest advantage the RAF can bring to the Armed Forces is by acting as support for the British Army, protecting our soldiers from aerial assault and providing close air support for our infantryman on the ground."
ENG_support_army: "Supporting the British Army"
ENG_support_army_desc: "While controlling the skies is all well and good there are other tactics we could employ to better support the lads on the ground. If we were to develop small maneuverable bombers that could strike at the supply convoys, artillery batteries and even armour on the field we could feasibly save thousands of infantry men while also bleeding our enemies dry."
ENG_control_skies: "Controlling the Skies"
ENG_control_skies_desc: "If our military campaigns are to be successful we need to control the skies above the fighting. If this is to be possible we will need to both increase the production rate of our newer fighters but also invest in new and innovative fighter technologies which could increase speed, firepower and maneuverability."
ENG_develop_fighters: "Prototype New Fighters"
ENG_develop_fighters_desc: "Our designers have spent the last months working on a new fighter project which has been codenamed Project Meteor. This project was intended to create an entirely new generation of fighter which will use a new type of jet engine propulsion in an attempt to gain an advantage in speed and range over our foes."

ENG_radar_concept: "The RDF Concept"
ENG_radar_concept_desc: "Radio Detection Finding or more simply RDF has been an idea since 1934. The theory behind it is to use Radio waves to detect approaching enemies before even spyglasses could see them. This will give us the ability to scramble the RAF and the rest of the military in advance of any assault. Assuming it works that is."
ENG_controlled_intercept: "Ground-Controlled Interception"
ENG_controlled_intercept_desc: "RDF has turned out to be a smashing success, allowing the RAF to be prepared well in advance of enemy raids. But we could take this farther. By having operators in the RDF stations in contact with the RAF pilots at all times we could feasibly direct them to the weakest points of enemy bomber and fighter squadrons allowing for greater tactical efficacy and more co-ordinated flying."
ENG_future_warfare: "The Future of Warfare"
ENG_future_warfare_desc: "Air power is the most effective way to project our military power across the globe. Unlike the Navy and the Army, it is capable of fighting and supporting our troops wherever we need to send them. Some of our scientists have been discussing the idea of making weapons and engines molded after rocket batteries. These could deliver a powerful payload long distances without risking human lives."

ENG_nott_project: "The Porton Down Project"
ENG_nott_project_desc: "Opened in 1916 to test chemical weapons used during the Great War, Porton Down has since come to encompass all experimental military projects currently in development in the United Kingdom, including their newest and most encompassing task. Codenamed the Porton Down Project."

# - RN

ENG_thern: "Mastery of the Seas"
ENG_thern_desc: "The Royal Navy has been the pride of Britain since our glorious victory at the Battle of Trafalgar back in 1805, establishing itself as the most powerful naval force the world has ever seen, with our country using it to great effect in expanding and protecting the borders of our Empire. After the Great War much has changed, and even the Royal Navy has seen a decrease in popularity and in quality. It is time to rectify this."

ENG_faa: "Fleet Air Arm"
ENG_faa_desc: "With the additional of Carriers to the Royal Navy new strategic possibilities have arisen. If we work together with the expanding RAF we will be able to continue to be the naval innovator of the world and push the Empire into a new phase of naval warfare. One in which we have a major advantage."
ENG_exercises: "Convince the Admirals"
ENG_exercises_desc: "Convincing the Admiralty to move their focus from the big ships that have served the Royal Navy so well over the past century will prove exceedingly difficult. Many of the leadership in the Admiralty are staunchly in the favour of building ever more larger and powerful battleships to ensure we continue to have complete superiority over our foes."
ENG_protocv: "Prototype Carrier Designs"
ENG_protocv_desc: "Several members of the Royal Navy's Research Division have been working on designs for what they have called Project Dauntless. A new generation of naval carriers that will function as mobile airfields across the Seven Seas, allowing us to project more power than ever before."
ENG_gwlessons: "Lessons from the Great War"
ENG_gwlessons_desc: "During the Great War both in the English Channel and the North Sea we fought the Huns and their Kaisermarine. Here we learned many things about the modern face of naval warfare that we need to apply to our new carrier-based fleet lest we face a disaster like Jutland again."
ENG_escort_vessels: "Escort Vessels"
ENG_escort_vessels_desc: "While carriers are a powerful ship-class and the planes they transport more than able to deal damage to opposing fleets, they are not indestructible. Recent naval exercises have shown that without a large number of escort vessels carriers are easily dispatched by even a relatively small force. To ensure their safety we must design a new wave of Cruiser vessels."
ENG_exp_shipyards1: "Expand Naval Shipyards"
ENG_exp_shipyards1_desc: "If Project Dauntless is to come to succeed we will not only need reaserchers to design these new carriers, but also shipyards large enough to accomodate their construction. As such the Admiralty has requested additional Government funding to expand several pre-existing dockyards from which these new carriers will be constructed and launched."
ENG_reorg_admiralty: "Re-organise the Admiralty"
ENG_reorg_admiralty_desc: "Now with Project Dauntless in full swing we can finally deal with the bloat in our naval command structure. Many of the old guard still do not quite understand the tactics of aerial warfare or how to apply them at sea. If we pull up some young commanders from the Navy as well as perhaps some higher ups in the RAF we may be able to balance out this issue."
ENG_csg: "Carrier Strike Groups"
ENG_csg_desc: "Up until now we have been focusing on using the Carriers and their payloads to assault enemy vessels on the water, but planes are not solely a naval weapon. If we organize our carrier aircraft into proper strike groups we could effectively use our navy to penetrate deeper inland allowing us to further support the British Army and RAF from the safety of the seas."

ENG_grandfleet: "The Grand Fleet"
ENG_grandfleet_desc: "The Pride and Joy of the British Military ahs always been her Grand Fleet. She has been the envy of the world and has , in the end, defeated every major pwoer who sought to challenge her supremacy. The Royal Navy will continue in this task, and we will ensure that everywhere across the world a Royal Navy vessel will be found."
ENG_learn_jutland: "Learn from Jutland"
ENG_learn_jutland_desc: "While ultimately a victory in the strategic sense, the Battle of Jutland was extremely close to a tactical defeat. The Kaisermarine's superior gunnery, better naval craftsmanship and better equipment ensured we suffered far greater losses than we should have in a battle where we had the far superior advantage. To avoid another calamity like this again we must learn from our past mistakes."
ENG_mod_bb: "Modern Battleship Designs"
ENG_mod_bb_desc: "Battleships are the pinnacle of naval warfare, with cannons capable of obliterating our foes from afar. As we learned during the Great War, however, our enemies are creating ships that can compete with ours. We must not let our advantage wane. The Royal Navy needs to leverage the newest techs to create a new generation of battleships fitting the prefix Her Majesty's Ship."
ENG_battlefleet: "Battlefleet Doctrine"
ENG_battlefleet_desc: "Due to our focus on the Battleship we have a consistent flow of new ships designs and strategies in which to employ them. While many of these ideas are years away, it would bring us a significant advantage to begin a series of naval exercises to familairise ourselves with these new concepts."
ENG_dd_screens: "Destroyer Screens"
ENG_dd_screens_desc: "On the surface of the oceans our Battleships are unmatche, in both numbers and technology we pull well ahead of our rivals. However, there is an unseen danger to our surface fleet. Beneath the waves German U-boats proved that they can sink even the largest ships in our fleet. To mitigate future losses from the submarine menace we must ensure our Destroyers remain up-to-date with new ASW technologies."
ENG_convoy_escort: "Convoy Escort Experience"
ENG_convoy_escort_desc: "Britain is an island that relies heavily on goods imported from the rest of the Empire. These convoys need to be protected during war time, but we can’t risk valuable battleships on this relatively minor mission. We need to create a newer model cruiser, light enough to keep pace with the convoy ships but with enough fire power to deter enemy ships and U-boats."
ENG_mobile_squad: "Mobile Squadrons"
ENG_mobile_squad_desc: "With an Empire as large and expansive as ours having the largest and heaviest Battleship only serves to allow us to defeat our foes, but only if we catch them first. Building upon the Battlecruiser philosophy of the Great War we will create a new generation of vessels with armament equal of any Battleship, but with the speed to catch maurading vessels harassing our trade routes."
ENG_fast_bb: "Fast Battleships"
ENG_fast_bb_desc: "As the Admiralty places a new emphasis on speed rather than superior armament, a new class of Battleships will need to be developed. Ships emphasising speed and expediency for dealing with threats across our vast Empire as they arise."
ENG_bc_refit: "Battlecruiser Refits"
ENG_bc_refit_desc: "Our current roster of Battlecruisers are relatively outdated, with some still focused on the theories of the Great War. In order to ensure our supremacy in this area we must refit our Battlecruiser fleet with the latest in naval technology."
ENG_escort_killers: "Escort Killers"
ENG_escort_killers_desc: "If we intend to starve our enemies of supplies, as we did so effectively in the last war, we will need to furhter our Battlecruiser designs and set them loose upon the high seas with the goal of destroying enemy trade wherever it is found."
ENG_inter_tactics: "Interception Tactics"
ENG_inter_tactics_desc: "Pioneering new theories on intercepting any trade across the seas will allow our fast battleships and battlecruiser squadrons to effectively hunt down and destroy enemy convoys, successfully strangling the enemy into submission."
ENG_nav_course: "Naval Construction Courses"
ENG_nav_course_desc: "While our engineers and craftsman are some of the best in the world, they could be better. Creating new technical and engineering schools with a focus on naval construction techniques will ensure that we remain the dominant nation in naval construction across the globe."
ENG_mod_nav_cons: "Modern Naval Construction"
ENG_mod_nav_cons_desc: "Our incentives have drawn many men from across the Empire to come and aid in the construction of naval vessels. With this influx of new talent we can direct our efforts to formulating new techniques to expediate the building of our larger naval vessels."
ENG_cls: "Destroyer Command Vessels"
ENG_cls_desc: "While our squadrons of Destroyers operate well against enemy submersibles, the Admiralty has inquired into the possibility of creating new Cruiser vessels to defend our ASW operations from larger threats that would normally dispatch our Destroyers with ease."
ENG_subs: "Undersea Raiders"
ENG_subs_desc: "With their efficacy proven in the Great War, the Admiralty has in the previous decade made many strides towards creating new and more deadly submersibles. As our position becomes increasibly threatened by nearby belligerent powers we must actively direct efforts towards updating and modernising our submarine fleet."
ENG_rbritannia: "Rule, Britannia!"
ENG_rbritannia_desc: "When Britain first, at Heaven's command\nArose from out the azure main;\nThis was the charter of the land,\nAnd guardian angels sang this strain:\nRule, Britannia! Britannia rule the waves\nBritons, never never never will be slaves!"

#####Black Wednesday & Eco Recovery Tree#####

ENG_black_wed: "London Market Collapse"
ENG_black_wed_desc: "Disaster has struck the Empire. The previous week has been a hard one for the Economy - with ongoing colonial revolts in India and Africa causing a shortage of goods, and the arrest of several executives and CEO of the Hatry group - the British Stock Market has crashed. Britain’s economic power up until this point couldn’t be ignored. Now however, economists can only guess when we will recover."
ENG_black_wed_tt: "§GThis focus will be automatically be bypassed once the London Stock Market has crashed.§!"
ENG_austerity: "Stopgap Austerity"
ENG_austerity_desc: "Conservative members our parliament are arguing that the best way to save the Empire from this economic catastrophe is to tighten the belts nation-wide. At the very least this can’t make matters any worse than they already are, but the populace many not be overly pleased with this new policy."
ENG_redu_budget: "Reduce Military Budget"
ENG_redu_budget_desc: "The first place that will feel the restriction of funding is our military. The British Army, RAF and Royal Navy are all seeing massive slashes in funding for both equipment and recruitment."
ENG_cut_invest: "Cut Overseas Investment"
ENG_cut_invest_desc: "While the Home Islands have been investing in our overseas colonies for years the time has come for us to look to our own needs first. By cutting our government’s investment in dominion, colonial and unaffiliated corporations we may be able to bounce back from this disaster."
ENG_unprofit: "Close Unprofitable Factories"
ENG_unprofit_desc: "The Chancellor of the Exchequer has proposed yet another manner to cut back on our spending; the closure of several industries across the British Isles that have been subsidised for one reason or another. These generally bring in less revenue than we spend on their upkeep, it may lose some workers their jobs in the short term, but in the long it could help save our economy."
ENG_new_taxes: "Raise New Taxes"
ENG_new_taxes_desc: "The coffers of the government need to be filled if we are going to recover from this disaster and as distasteful as it may be to some, the most expedient way to fill those coffers is to levy a new tax. The new “Emergency Tax” will be levied on all British citizens until the crisis is averted."
ENG_sector_cuts: "Civil Service Cuts"
ENG_sector_cuts_desc: "Civil servants - while helpful - are not entirely necessary to run our nation, and while we can not dispose of all of them, we are able to significantly cut down their number, especially in regions known in the past to be “Prone to Rebellion”, with rural Ireland and Scotland will suffering the worst of these cutbacks."

ENG_stimulus: "Economic Stimulus"
ENG_stimulus_desc: "Some of the more radical members of parliament having suggested that if we are to recover from this catastrophe we are going to need to inject money into the economy. While this will be met with tremendous popular support, it will take a great deal of political capital to push through, and if it fails, it will surely only make matters worse."
ENG_produ_quota: "Establish Production Quotas"
ENG_produ_quota_desc: "The first step to reorganising our economy will be to establish production quotas for vital industries across the nation. Corporations may argue that they will be forced to close since they won’t be able to turn a profit if they waste the goods, but if we buy the surplus that they can’t sell it will keep our people employed and our businessman investing."
ENG_inflation: "Create Inflation Controls"
ENG_inflation_desc: "In order to control inflation across the nation we must approach the Bank of England and convince them to raise interest rates in an effort to reduce the money supply across the Empire."
ENG_subsidies: "Unemployment Subsidies"
ENG_subsidies_desc: "While we will try out best to ensure every eligible man is employed there will always be those we miss, or those who did not work before the crash. If create a service of unemployment subsidies we can ensure they have enough to feed themselves, and more importantly, keep buying from the British Market."
ENG_target_tax: "Targeted Taxes"
ENG_target_tax_desc: "We have spent ourselves so far into the red that if we don’t find a way to at least take some of the pressure of we will officially be bankrupt. The best way to try and at least slow the drop would be a tax, but that would defeat the purpose of trying to put more money in the people hands. Our Labour friends in Parliament have proposed a solution: the creation of a targeted tax aimed at the upper classes of society."
ENG_tariffs: "Import Tariffs"
ENG_tariffs_desc: "The Pound, while stable within our own borders has lost a great deal of it value world wide, buying goods from regions external to the Empire is now outrageously expensive. So, in order to make our goods more competitive in local markets we will impose a Tariff on all foreign goods."

ENG_mosleys_plan: "Mosley's Plan"
ENG_mosleys_plan_desc: "With the Labour & ILP coalition victory in our recent election, Oswald Mosley has been made Chancellor of the Exchequer, an important position in determining our actions to counter the growing financial crisis across the Empire."
ENG_pub_works: "Public Works"
ENG_pub_works_desc: "While conservatives in parliament argue that we don’t have the money to 'build fountains and plant trees' Mosley assures us that these projects will not only create jobs for unemployed labourers, but also give invaluable experience for our workforce in the coming years."
ENG_pensions: "Retirement Pensions Scheme"
ENG_pensions_desc: "Everyone needs money in order to live. Not least of all our senior citizens. While they can not work due to the ill effects of age they are still a vital part of our economy. By creating a pension policy, they will have money which they can use to survive and also to spend, not only will this keep them safe, but it may even help keep businesses open."
ENG_infra_projects: "Infrastructure Projects"
ENG_infra_projects_desc: "Britain is a modern nation and as such has miles upon miles of road and rail. Not only does existing infrastructure need to be kept in good condition, new expansion must be made to accomodate the growing population of Britain."
ENG_home_market: "Concentrate on the Home Market"
ENG_home_market_desc: "Britain can sustain itself if we all work together. If we invest in homebound industries, especially those for which our people have a great need, we can build up more men from poverty and protecting our people from the loss of basic necessities."
ENG_national_effort: "The Great National Effort"
ENG_national_effort_desc: "Mosley's plan actually worked. Regardless of the criticisms of nay-sayers and other inidividuals Britain has pulled through the worst of the economic crisis, and in record pace. And we have achieved this great triumph not through the costly policies of austerity, but by helping those in Britain to once more stand on their own two feet."

ENG_continue_austerity: "Full Austerity"
ENG_continue_austerity_desc: "With bankruptcy an ever-looming spectre the decision has been made that we are going to cut expenditure wherever we can, everyone is going to need to tighten their belts, these cuts will be felt all through society, from the coal miner to the King."
ENG_devalue: "Devalue the Pound Sterling"
ENG_devalue_desc: "If we devalue the Pound those goods will be cheaper, cheaper goods mean that more people will buy our goods. Hopefully this will give our coffers the boost we need to make those first steps to recovery."
ENG_interest: "Raise Bank Interest Rates"
ENG_interest_desc: "By raising the interest rates on some our largest borrowers, namely the banks themselves, we can get them to either pay back their debts quicker for fear of more debt accruing or just end up getting more money back if they continue to wait on repayment, either way we win."
ENG_further_cuts: "Further Budget Cuts"
ENG_further_cuts_desc: "Many believe that the cuts we have made so far are all that is possible. They are wrong, and we will show them that there is still more funding that we can cut."
ENG_mil_cuts: "Slash Military Funding"
ENG_mil_cuts_desc: "Our soldiers fought valiantly in the great war, they were well paid and well equipped, but right now we need to decide what is more important, new guns and well-paid soldiers, or the national economy. The answer seems simple, it would seem the time has come to gut the British Military"
ENG_cut_benefits: "Cut Unemployment Benefits"
ENG_cut_benefits_desc: "Right now, we have some systems in place that pay the unemployed. If we trim these down to only those who are incapable of working for major medical reasons or better yet remove them entirely, we can not only save money but incentives peoples to go out and join the work force."
ENG_cut_invest2: "Reduce National Investment"
ENG_cut_invest2_desc: "Some people argue that you need to spend money in order to make money, but in some cases, that is just not feasible. In a crisis such as this, we must withdraw funding that is not necessary from everywhere we can, including those areas in Britain that we have invested in."
ENG_end_austerity: "Ending Austerity"
ENG_end_austerity_desc: "Hundreds of factories have close and thousands have been out of work, but now, thanks to our frugal savings we can safely say that no only is the worst over but that we have escaped the London Market Crash, and not a moment too soon."

ENG_lfaire: "Ending Intervention"
ENG_lfaire_desc: "Government intervention in the economy is a fatal mistake and will only lead to greater ruin. The purpose of Government is politics, not economics. Things should be left well enough alone."
ENG_end_subs: "Restrict Government Subsidies"
ENG_end_subs_desc: "In recent years successive Governments have allowed subsidies to be sent to poor performing businesses and factories in an attempt to maintain the number of employed persons throughout the country. Such a move is folly, and must be revoked."
ENG_lift_caps: "Lift Interest Caps"
ENG_lift_caps_desc: "Lifting interest caps on loans to businesses throughout the Empire may result in many businesses going out of business, but if they can't afford to pay back these loans, why did they take them out in the first place?"
ENG_liberate_markets: "Liberate the Markets"
ENG_liberate_markets_desc: "The Government has no business in business, so the saying goes. While many considered our policies that of a bygone age, today they have borne fruit, albeit at great suffering. The British Economy has adapted to the new financial climate and is running at full steam once again, proving that our choices were the right ones to make."

#####Imperial Foreign Policy#####

ENG_impfp: "Imperial Foreign Policy"
ENG_impfp_desc: "Though we retreated into isolation following the end of the Great War, the time has come once more to decide the future of the Empire. Shall we continue our focus on isolation, with our priorities on developing the Empire? Or shall we once more call forward another great wave of imperialism, with our nation at the helm."
ENG_impfp_tt: "§GThis focus will be automatically be bypassed once the British Imperial Conference has been concluded.§!"

ENG_standsalone: "The Empire Stands Alone"
ENG_standsalone_desc: "Stand up straight and relish our duty as we exist in the eye of the storm of the world. Nations and Kingdoms will rise and fall, but the Empire will stand and survive for eternity."

ENG_med_def: "Defence of the Mediterranean"
ENG_med_def_desc: "Our Mediterranean acquisitions are some of our most recent acquisitions, but their strategic importance is paramount. If these were to fall to enemy power it would strike us a hard blow, this must be prevented at all costs."
ENG_gib_fort: "Fortress Gibralter"
ENG_gib_fort_desc: "Acquired following the signing of the Treaty of Utrecht in the late 18thC, Gibraltar has since functioned as an important naval base and strategic location which ensures our ability to police naval traffic in an out of the Mediterranean. With this in mind, Gibraltar's defences are of prime concern."
ENG_sky_control: "Control of the Skies"
ENG_sky_control_desc: "While we can influence the Mediterrean Sea with the Royal Navy since the Great War and advent of the flying machine, new weapons and defences are required to both protect and extend our influence across the Mediterranean."
ENG_adv_warning: "Advanced Warning"
ENG_adv_warning_desc: "Though our strategic bases across the Mediterranean are relatively well defended, the threat of air power being brought against them is significant. To ensure their continued success, we should establish several RDF stations across these territories to warn our forces when an air raid is imminent."
ENG_lifeline: "The Lifeline of the Empire"
ENG_lifeline_desc: "Officially opened in November of 1869, the Suez Canal has since functioned as an extremely important location to ensure continued communication and supply from the heartland of Britain to the farthest reaches of the Empire. Suez must be defended and at all costs, even if it is the last territory we are left in control of in North Africa."

ENG_hi_def: "Home Isles Defence"
ENG_hi_def_desc: "The Heart and Soul of the Empire - Britannia herself - must be defended by any and all means, lest the unthinkable happen: that Britain falls and the Empire be thrown into chaos."
ENG_reinf_scapa: "Reinforce Scapa Flow"
ENG_reinf_scapa_desc: "Arguably one of our most important naval bases, Scapa Flow allows us to project naval power into the North Sea and in the previous war assisted us in containing the threat of the German Navy. If we are to fight another war Scapa Flow must be prepared to wage another conflict, potentially more brutal than the last."
ENG_remember_1066: "Remember 1066"
ENG_remember_1066_desc: "The Battle of Hastings decided the fate of our nation for centuries following its wake. Never can we allow an enemy to march on British land. We must defend our shores, whatever the cost may be."
ENG_decen_command: "Decentralised Command"

ukbw.1.t: "Bank Closure"
ukbw.1.d: "As the effects of the London Market Collapse continue to influence the financial situation of our nation more and more companies and businesses are going bankrupt. Today a prominent banking institution in one of our prominent industrial regions announced that they would be closing several unprofitable branches in the area in an effort to cut costs and stay afloat.\n\nUnfortunately this is going to result in an increase in unemployment and the inability for the Government to continue using the profits gained by the bank branch itself."
ukbw.1.a: "Blast!"
ukbw.2.t: "Factory Strike"
ukbw.2.d: "In an attempt to cut costs several important businesses in our nation have begun slashing employee salaries in order to save themselves money in the production of goods in the region. While these cuts normally go through with only minor grumbling, a local trade union has announced a strike in several of the factories effected. The company owners are unwilling to negotiate with the strikers and for the time being it will result in decreased production in the area."
ukbw.2.a: "Just ignore them"
ukbw.3.t: "Trade Union Demands"
ukbw.3.d: "With a local strike taking shape in one of our more influential industrial regions, owners of the factories effected have decided to negotiate with the trade union orchestrating the strike. The owners have invited the Government to mediate the dispute over the coming week, this is likely to sap some degree of our attention so long as the situation persists."
ukbw.3.a: "Now now gentlemen, we can work this out"
ukbw.4.t: "King Edward Intervenes"
ukbw.4.d: "Local situations continue to worsen as the effects of the London Market Collapse get worse by the month. Today King Edward VIII visited an area particularly affected by the economic crisis, and while his visit was supposed to be a morale-booster for those worst effected, it has had some unforeseen consequences. The King has apparently been quite effected by the plight of those suffering and made several political promises that indicate his intention to involve himself directly in order to solve the situation. Whether or not he does so does not matter by making these comments he has weakened our Government and increased public support for himself."
ukbw.4.a: "How dare he!"
ukbw.5.t: "Marxist Rally"
ukbw.5.d: "Large numbers of journalists were spotted today reporting on a Marxist Rally being held in one of our cities affected by recent factory closures. Normally a rally such as this would go unnoticed, but larger-than-normal crowds attracted the attention of local journalists, who are now running stories of political support and sympathies for Marxist political policies being at an all time high. Regardless of the story's veracity, it has succeeded in drawing public interest to those who organised the rally."

#-Normal Events
uk.1.t: "State of the Empire"
uk.1.d: "With its victory in the Great War against the Central Powers, Britain re-affirmed its status as the global hegemon through naval domination. However the horrendous cost in casualties impacted the internal politics of the Empire more than could have been forseen. In the Imperial Conferences of 1917-18, Britain had promised her Dominions 'a full recognition as autonomous nations of an Imperial Commonwealth', with the purpose of increased autonomy and giving each Dominion in the Empire an 'adequate voice' in foreign policy, rights that were to be eventually extended to British India as well. \n\nDespite these promises, with victory comes hubris, British politicians preferred to see a resumption of a status quo in the Empire, with Dominions nominally subservient to London; they feared that any increase in autonomy may eventually lead to the break-up of the Empire that those in the Great War had fought and died to defend. This political crisis abated as the economic boom in Great Britain spread throughout the Empire. As manufacturing levels in the Empire soared, so did the need for resources, and with an expansive colonial empire, Britain was not short for needed goods, however the method of procuring increased resources was to come at a price. \n\nRapid industrialisation and resource extraction led to the mass employment of colonial people's in order to fuel the Empire, their conditions were poor and their payment worse, something that British politicians were willing to forget so long as the money continued to flow. Eventually these conditions reached a boiling point, with the crucible being achieved in India. \n\nToday the revolt has spread. India is on the precipice of leaving the Empire, the British garrison is few and those in revolt, numerous. To make matters worse, since the refusal of the House of Commons to pass the Statute of Westminster in 1931 - with it instead a highly cut down version of the bill being passed, the Statute of Autonomy -, relations with the Dominion states have soured greatly. The up-coming Imperial Conference of 1937 is sure to see a renewed interest in the autonomy of the Dominion states of the Empire. Should Westminster once again decide to delay autonomy then she may face further rebellion than just her India territories, but if she should acquiesce, it may mean the end of the Empire altogether."
uk.1.a: "Interesting times ahead"
uk.2.t: "London Stock Market Crash"
uk.2.d: "Last week saw a tumultuous five days for the London Stock Market. Fuelled by fears of a shortage of goods and resources due to the on-going revolt in colonial Africa and India, the stock exchange continued to vary wildly as news dripped out from Westminster regarding efforts to prevent further insurrection throughout the Empire.\n\nIt appears the worst was yet to come.\n\nFollowing the conclusion of the trial of the CEO of Hatry Group - prominent businessman Clarence Hatry - and his associates with the imprisonment of all those under investigation for the crimes of mass fraud and forgery, investor confidence in the stock market plummeted. Mass selling ensued over the course of today, with traders seemingly in a frenzy of panic.\n\nAs the Government scrambles to find a way to prepare for the economic repurcussions, the effects of the 1936 London Stock Market Crash are certain to be felt beyond Britain, most of all in the Empire and its Dominions."
uk.2.a: "My God!"
uk.3.t: "A Peaceful Ending at Midnight"
uk.3.d: "King George V is dead. This morning a note was attached to the gates of Buckingham Palace, it announced that the King had died peacefully in his sleep last night surrounded by his family. His son the Prince of Wales is set to assume the title of King Edward VIII it was declared as well. \n\nAssuming the title of King-Emperor upon the death of his father, King George V reigned for twenty-five years, seeing our Empire through to its victory in the Great War. Known for his courage and passion in military matters, His Majesty even visited troops near the front-line on the Western Front. \n\nA man known for his love of both family and country, thousands have taken to the streets across our Empire, from Winnipeg to Wellington, to mourn the loss of one of the most beloved monarchs in our history."
uk.3.a: "More than a King, a father of a great family."
uk.4.t: "King Edward VIII assassinated"
uk.4.d: "Late this Afternoon, a lone gunman produced a loaded revolver as His Majesty, King-Emperor Edward VIII, rode on horseback at Constitution Hill near Buckingham Palace. Despite the men of Scotland Yard spotting the gun, the man was able to discharge the weapon twice before he was tackled to the ground and disarmed. As the crowd scattered from the gunman, it was discovered moments later that the King was dead, suffering a gun-shot wound to the chest which is believed to have pierced his heart. \n\nThe nation is in shock. Not only is this the first murder of a Monarch since Charles I almost three hundred years ago, it is the first time a gunman has been able to close to within firing distance of a member of the Royal Family. Questions have been raised as to the efficiency of Scotland Yard and how this could have been allowed to occur, but more worringly the identity and motive of the gunman is yet to be determined. \n\nAlready whispers have begun to spread regarding the murder. Some say that he was a known Marxist, dedicated to the cause of anti-imperialism, which he regarded the British monarchy as champions of. Others tell tales that he was a colonial revolutionary, determined to see his nation free from the control of the Empire. The truth may be worse than either of these rumours; it may be that we will never discover the gunman's true motives. Whatever the case, the assassination of King-Emperor Edward VIII has sent shockwaves through the political establishment in Britain. \n\nA tentative calm has fallen over Britain, with some believing that the worst is yet to come."
uk.4.a: "Whatever the future brings, Britain will survive!"
uk.5.t: "King Edward VIII survives assassination attempt"
uk.5.d: "This afteroon, as King-Emperor Edward VIII rode on horseback at Constitution Hill near Buckingham Palace, a lone gunman produced a loaded revolver and took aim at the King. Due to the valiant efforts of members of the crowd, the would-be assassin was tackled to the ground and held in position until members of Scotland Yard hurried to the location. \n\nSo far the King-Emperor has released a statement regarding the situation saying that he and his family were unharmed, yet somewhat shook, by the attempted murder. Quietly questions are being asked about the competency of Scotland Yard which allowed a gunman to get within firing distance of a member of the Royal Family. Although many are simply glad that the assassination was a failure. \n\nThe man in question, identified as one Jerome Bannigan, has been placed in custody of Scotland Yard with his trial pending. A known fraudster, the motives for the attempted murder are unknown at this time, it may be many months before a reason is identified, if one can be found at all. \n\nFor many, this recent act is emblematic of a larger political problem in the Empire. For others, they are simply happy to know that for now a crisis has been averted."

uk.6.d: "As the new year begins, the date of the next Imperial Conference approaches ever closer. While still several months away, preparations are currently being made to host the Imperial delegates of the Conference. Work so far has focused in London, the traditional meeting place of the Conference, we have however been recently contacted by the Dominion of Canada regarding a possible change of location.\n\nThe Canadians propose that we instead host the conference in Ottawa where they have been secretely working on their own building to host the event.\n\nWhile this choice is relatively benign, it may serve to improve relations between ourselves and our Dominions by showing that this Empire is truly one of equals. Although hosting it in London will send the message not only to the Dominions, but to the world, that the British Empire has but one master."

The Australian and New Zealand delegations made a joint statement where they wished to express interest in increased investment in their territories, as well as policies where the British Government would encourage immigration to both Australia and New Zealand. The Irish and Indian delegation raised their concern of growing unrest in both of their nations, as well as their interest in more autonomy as a means of counter-acting it.\n\n While many within our Government are considering these statements as the usual complaints and suggestions, others believe that if they are not properly resolved in this Imperial Conference that we may see increased revolt against our rule. Whatever our choices, we must move carefully lest we lose control of the Empire altogether."

uk.8.t: "Imperial Conference Day 1: Economic Policy"
uk.8.d: "The agenda on the first day of the 1937 Imperial Conference is to be the economic policy of the Empire. Many of our Dominions, and the Home Isles included, are still suffering greatly from the effects of the London Market Collapse only 9 months ago. With our industrial and economic leverage over the Empire, it will be possible for us to determine the course we will take together to solve this crisis.\n\nWhile we have only limited investment to spare for the Dominions, we can target it to a specific area to assist them in their construction. The most popular idea that has been raised for far by the combined Australasian delegates is one of increased industrial construction, to facilitate bringing more of the unemployed back into the workplace, and to spur on the combined economies of the Empire. Alternatively we may also divert our investment towards the construction of infrastructure throughout the Empire, to allow us to access the more remote territories of the Empire with greater ease.\n\nFinally, there are those who suggest that this investment should go towards militarising the Empire, as there are fears that with growing instability in both Europe and abroad, we may be required to involve ourselves more directly in the coming future."

uk.9.d: "Given our dominant military position over the parts of the Empire, it has come to us to decide our united foreign policy in regards to the coming years.\n\nSince the end of the Great War we have retreated into isolation as a means of preserving the integrity of our Empire, although with growing threats abroad this policy is regularly being challenged within the Empire.\n\nOur first choice is to continue the policy of isolation that we have maintained since the end of the Great War, while this policy is likely to ensure the stability of our nation and the Empire at large, it will limit our ability to pursue meaningful affairs with other nations around the world.\n\nThe final alternative is one that is surely to generate the most resistance from the Dominions, the proposition that we once again attempt to expand our Empire. While we do already control over a quarter of the globe, the more hawkish members of our Parliament and others firmly believe that when Empires stop expanding they eventually fall, in this case we must exapnd or perish. This policy brings with it the greatest risks, but also the greatest opportunities. Any attempt to make expansionism Imperial Policy is likely to shake the foundations of our Empire."
uk.9.a: "Imperial interests lie in maintaining our isolation"
uk.9.b: "Civilisation must be brought to the barbarians of the world!"
uk.10.t: "Imperial Conference Day 3: Internal Policy"
uk.10.d: "Perhaps the most important day of this year's Imperial Conference has arrived, the meeting where we dicsuss the combined future of the Empire.\n\nSince its inception, Westminster has always attempted to maintain control over the Dominions and while this was difficult in the early days of our Empire, it has grown increasingly easier as technology has finally caught up. During this time Dominion states have grown accustomed to their autonomy and many of the delegations, notably the Canadians, have only demanded more as their nation has both become richer and more populous during the economically booming 1920's.\n\nThe only thing that is known for sure is that any attempt to further pursue the Status Quo is likely to lead to increased dissidence against our rule, one that may have unforeseen consequences for both ourselves and others. With this in mind, many believe that the time has come to begin loosening the chains that bind our Dominions altogether, and to begin the moves towards their ultimate independence. However, there is another alternative.\n\nPrior to the Great War, an energetic part of the political class both in Britain and in the Dominions had been advocating for a type of Federation between the Empire. One where the Dominions would be granted equal representation inside a proposed Imperial Parliament, where all the parts of the Empire would be united. Those who support this arrangement argue that it may stamp out all attempts at future independence of our Dominion states, while making us an exceptionally strong force on the global stage. The critics of this policy argue that it would be impossible to force either the Indian or South African delegations to accept this measure, and that we would likely see revolt in both of these locations should we attempt any to impose direct rule from London.\n\nOur choices are many, and their consequences potentially disastrous for the Empire. Today will mark a major turning point of our Empire regardless of which decision we make. For the sake of everything we hold dear, we must choose carefully."

uk.11.d: "While the topic of greater autonomy for Ireland was not expected to be raised during the Fourteenth Imperial Conference, the Irish delegation took the time to gain support from the Dominions of the Empire as a means of pressuring Westminster into once more revisiting the issue.\n\nThe issue of the Irish Republican Brotherhood continuing to attack and disrupt our ability to govern Ireland has been raised, and many in our Government believe that the time may have arrived to finally give Ireland a greater degree of Home Rule as a means of starving the Brotherhood politically. \n\nThe hard-liners in our Government suggest that if we cave politically to autonomy now, it will only embolden the IRB to take further action against us, potentially making a more significant impact politically if they can succeed in claiming they were the reason for more autonomy being granted. Those who oppose Home Rule therefore argue that the time has arrived for us to politically push for an acceptance of the status quo in Ireland. \n\nThe process will likely entail compromise and may not triumph, but its success will mean an end to the IRB and an end to political troubles in Ireland, with this in mind perhaps a greater degree of Home Rule will solve our problems at the very least temporarily."

Whle our choices so far have made little impact throughout an Empire as expansive as ours, it will not take long before the Governments of the respective Dominion states effected by our policies officially meet and forge their own reaction to our decisions. In the coming weeks and months we may see increased instability throughout the Empire as the Dominions begin to adapt to the new reality.\n\nWe must prepare ourselves for any eventuality, and stand fast against any attempts to destroy the Empire from without, or perhaps, from within."

uk.20.d: "As the London Market Collapse continues to effect the world, there is no place hurt more than our own nation. The Tyneside town of Jarrow has been particularly damaged by the effects of the economic crash, with several factories being closed, and the important Palmer's Shipyard.\n\nToday several hundred now unemployed men held a meeting where they announced their intention to march to London in order to present the Government with a petition to re-open the industry in Jarrow that is crucial to employment.\n\nWhile normally this sort of event would go unnoticed, the media has made much fuss of it, and it has attracted both the attention and imagination of the public going so far as to win support of some more prominent local leaders.\n\nAs the March continues over the coming month it will likely be a source of political instability that will only inflame the on-going political crisis following the London Market Collapse."

uk.21.d: "As the Jarrow March enters its first week there have been numerous worrying signs of public approval and support for the marchers which was particularly emphasised today.\n\nMarchers were greeted by several locals as they entered Ferryhill in County Durham, where they were offered food and drink as well as a great showing of support. This is expected to continue as the march progresses as many within our nation suffer identical situations to the Jarrow Marchers."

uk.23.d: "As the Jarrow March continues to attract public attention throughout our country, we have recieved worrying news from local police officers in the area as to new elements infiltrating the March itself. Suspected members of both the British Socialist Party and the Worker's International League have apparently been stirring up trouble during the March by attempting to encourage those marching to become more vocal and forceful in their refutations of Government policy.\n\nWhile so far they appear to have been unsuccessful, many within our Government have begun to worry that the Jarrow March may soon become a front for the radical socialist elements of our society, which may then attempt to use it to cause disruption in the capital.\n\nFacing this we are left with two choices; allow the march to continue and deal with whatever consequences may occur, or order the police to end the march now, likely to the great detriment to our Government."

After the attack, the Police were forced to defend themselves and arrested several members of the crowd.\n\nThe Newspapers, as is typical of them, have plastered images of the affair all over their front pages and it has only served to damage our Government further. Scotland Yard has identified several of the marchers as members of the BSP and CPB and has advised us to put an end to the march now before it gets further out of hand as more radical individuals are drawn to the event."

It appears that the Communist Party of Britain was 'coincidentally' holding a rally in Hyde Park right before the Marchers arrived, which has served only to swell the number of those involved. While police estimates that the crowed is less than 3,000 it may grow over the coming days as the Marchers prepare to officialy hand over their petition to the Government to re-open Palmer's shipyard and several other key industries in Jarrow."

On our orders Scotland Yard successfuly, yet somewhat brutally, disbanded the march and those forming the core of the marchers were arrested and shipped back to Jarrow. The more radical elements of the march fled quickly as the Police approached, apparently forseeing what was to come.\n\nTypically the media has made a large fuss of the entire situation, accusing the Government and Scotland Yard of barbarism in the face of peaceful protest. The Government's popularity has been significantly damaged by this affair, but we may have avoided something far worse should we have allowed the march to continue."

While the Government is not in the habit of caving to the demands of a town with a relatively low population, the Jarrow March has captured the attention of the nation and our response will likely be examined and criticised for years to come.\n\nAny concessions to Jarrow will likely only encourage other towns to ask for similar Government intervention, but by refusing the petition our Government stands to allow more extremist political forces to make inroads in Britain's politics."

uk.28.t: "Manchester Mill Workers Strike"
uk.28.d: "The London Market Collapse has affected millions of people across the Empire, but none more so then the working class citizens of the North of England. The city of Manchester and its surrounding towns are dependent on cotton mills and cotton exports, so the severe decline in our countries exports has had a dire effect on the region with many companies going bust and the closure of factories and mills has resulted in hundreds of people being unemployed and impoverished. Factory and Mill workers fear for their jobs and families, and many have seen their wages cut causing major unrest in the area. This unrest has today caused disparate strikes throughout the region, with the biggest of these strikes taking place in the industrial town of Rochdale.\n\nAt 9: this morning, workers from one of the largest cotton mills in the town abandoned their work and marched out of the mill and onto the streets, blocking all traffic. They proceeded to march together to the town centre, all the while chanting and demanding better wages and working conditions with some even waving red flags. These strikes are unorganised and pose little threat but they should not be underestimated, they are a sign that our people are reaching breaking point.\n\nShould this crisis continue, we may face far worse than this in the coming months."
uk.28.a: "Local authorities can handle the situation"
uk.29.t: "Manchester Strike Expands"
uk.29.d: "As the largest operating Trade Union in the region, the Mill Workers Union recently hosted representatives from every Manchester Trade Union at an undisclosed location. While it is not unusual for Trade Unions to co-operate, it is highly unusual for it to happen on such a scale and in apparent secrecy, consequently the event has attracted enormous amounts of local media attention with many speculating what its effects will be.\n\nWhatever was discussed at that meeting, it is surely not going to be good for us."
uk.29.a: "It's always the trade unions stirring trouble..."
uk.30.t: "Manchester Strikers Present Demands"
uk.30.d: "The now nationwide famous Manchester Strikes have resulted today in the delivering of their demands to the Lord Mayor for Manchester Joseph Toole – an ex Labour MP who is now said to have an unofficial affiliation with the ILP. Their demands include, but are not limited to:\n\n1- An increase in workers’ wages.\n2- A commitment to improve the working and living conditions of workers.\n3- Employers must listen to the grievances of their workers and, where possible, assist in the alleviation of these issues.\n\nThe presenting of these demands gives the Government two choices: accept, or decline. To accept would be to submit to the will of the workers, and lose face with the rest of the world and our own people. To decline would mean violence and the potential for terrible bloodshed, should these strikers refuse to back down."

Today the negotiators have sent word to their representatives in Westminster that they have succeeded in working out a deal, apparently it was not as large a challenge as they expected, the trade union officials in particular were eager to take what they could get and refrained from making any serious demands."

Speculation persists as to the meeting itself, with many suggestions that there may have been a National Trade Union Congress in the making with the intention of setting up local political infrastructure in the event of more organised actions. For now it is anyone's guess what that action will involve, although we are sure to find out soon."

Leaflets were reportedly distributed to union members in several major towns and cities to prepare for action during this week, and to be ready at a moments notice. It was not until yesterday morning that Trade Union officials announced that a General Strike will be going ahead in the coming week in an attempt to force the Government to fold on numerous policies not only being implemented in Manchester but elsewhere as well. Our Government must act soon to head off this potential disaster in the making, we must choose our response carefully."

We will agree to roll-back several salary cuts in the worst areas effected throughout the nation, and guarantee that several Government owned industries will remain open to prevent further unemployment.\n\nThis whole situation has seriously weakened our Government's standing in the eyes of the British people, but perhaps the alternative would have been far worse."

uk.35.d: "Following orders from Westminster to launch a crack-down on the planned nation-wide general strike police forces were successful in breaking up several planned strikes before they began early yesterday morning, however word spread quickly among Trade Unions throughout the country. Today they have hastily erected barricades in several important industrial districts in Birmingham, Manchester, Liverpool, Glasgow and even some section of London. Police Commanders have reported that they are unable to break the defences of several locations without serious use of force, while in other areas escalations are already taken place with violence being exhanged between the police and the strikers.\n\nAs it stands the situation is rapidly worsening with strikers fortifying their positions further as more time passes. Following this, our Government is left with little choice to deal with the situation."

uk.36.t: "Protesters Close on Westminster"
uk.36.d: "Despite the recent declaration of martial law by the Government the revolters have progressed in many areas throughout the nation, securing additional streets and placing them under their nominal control. It appears that our heavy-handed approach to dealing with the situation has only led the public to become disillusioned with our own Government and side with the protestors.\n\nRegardless of these complications, it was not until this morning that events began to get much worse. Reports that military units have been refusing orders to put down civil unrest in many areas have begun to spread, in particular the brigade meant to be defending the London interior has only succeeded in holding back the protestors and has been unable to go on the offensive. Unless there is an immediate change in the the national situation we may face a level of unrest that up until now we had thought unthinkable. It is time for us to make a political statement if we are to resolve this crisis completely."

These were the words announced by radio today as the continuing civil unrest throughout the nation spread further, with Westminster itself under threat from force.\n\nSince the Government's statement little has occurred and rioting has ceased in major areas as Trade Union officials in charge decide what to do. One part of the country however, has used this time to further their own agenda. King Edward VIII is said to have been meeting with military leaders regularly since the civil unrest began and Westminster announced the implementation of martial law. These meetings have been held in secret so far, but given the King's well known tendency to involve himself directly in political matters one does not need binoculars to see what may soon be coming to Britain.\n\n In the coming days and weeks the choices that we make will determine the future of Britain itself."

Today marks a new era in British politics, and a brighter future for Britain and her Empire.' – The speech given by his Royal Majesty, King Edward VIII, after dissolving Parliament today.\n\nHis actions came as a great shock, not only to the people of Great Britain, but to the world as a whole as democracy has, for the first time since King Charles I, been discarded by the reigning monarch in an attempt for Absolute Monarchy. Many in the country view the actions of the King as a violation of their rights as people, with many socialists and communists protesting him fiercely stating that his actions are ‘the greatest violation of this country's people and their Human Rights we have ever seen.’ However, the King does have considerable support from inside the Government itself, with the majority of his support coming from the Military High Command and the ranks of the Military itself – thereby allowing Edward to assume control with very little resistance.\n\nDemocracy is one of the oldest British traditions and one can only wonder how long this new political reality will last."

The revolt took place following the orders given to Officers to open fire on the rioters, upon giving these orders their troops simply refused to act. When ordered once more to fire on the rioters, many troops began deserting and joining the ranks of the Socialists, with others firing on their own Officers. Needless to say, the rioting has now become more dangerous then we could ever have imagined and major firefights between the loyal units of the army and the rioters are taking place throughout London. While the remaining loyalist forces have positions in several important cities across the country, they are heavily outnumbered and will struggle to hold out for much longer. The Prime Minister, Sir Samuel Hoare, has today made a speech in the now paralysed House of Commons:\n\n'When these strikes began, it was inconceivable that the ridiculous politics of Socialism could ever shake the foundations of British democracy, and yet here we stand barricaded in our now irrelevant House of Commons surrounded by what of our military that has remained loyal to us. In this grand city, the centre of the world, Socialist and Collectivist insurgents run rampant destroying centuries of work by some of the greatest minds of mankind. Destroying the very democracy we seek to preserve and enjoy, the very democracy that is the basis of every right of every human. The very democracy that forms the basis of British morality and tradition. And yet, on this day, our own citizens seek to destroy this democracy, seek to destroy their own country for that matter, in the search for perfection. I speak for the whole of the House, I am sure, when I say that we have failed to deliver perfection. But I must also say, that they will never get any closer to it.'"

Luckily the worst of the damage seems to have been some major downstairs flooding as the Beernami broke down numerous house doors.\n\nThe wave appears to have originated from Meux and Company Brewery, and upon further inspection of the site it appears that one of the large vats storing the beer shattered overnight creating a domino effect that released some 323,000 Imperial Gallons of beer onto the street.\n\nAs morning descends upon the area the remainder of the wave has dissipated, the only proof that it had ever existed being flooded homes, damaged automobiles and some very unhappy locals."

Today history refers to it as the Easter Rising, a rising which was ultimately crushed by British Armed Forces after almost a brutal week of fighting in Dublin and other areas of the country. The leadership of the Irish Republican Brotherhood - the organisation behind the uprising - were captured by British forces and on the urging of the Irish Parliamentary Party their trial was post-poned until after the Great War. This choice was to prove a mistake as time rolled on.\n\nIn the waning years of the Great War the remaining members of the IRB launched a surprise operation to free their leadership from imprisonment. The security forces in the area were easily overwhelmed and the IRB leadership freed.\n\nToday we stand at a precipice; for two decades the IRB has continued to cause chaos in Ireland through attacks on the RIC and local industry and infrastructure. With our integration efforts proceeding well there only remains the final issue of dealing with the IRB itself.\n\nOur choice here will matter to the Irish people and whether they will be satisfied with the political status quo throughout the immediate future or if they will continue to drift from our influence in the coming years, accompanied by the inevitable political fallout. The use of the British Armed Forces to crush the IRB is likely to succeed, but the Irish people will not stand for British military units on the streets of Ireland in an attempt to deal with what is effectively an Irish affair. Our other choice is to use the RIC, recently strengthened by the efforts of our Government, to capture and arrest the IRB leadership. This choice is less likely to succeed, but if it does it will go a long way in sending the message to Ireland that outside major affairs, Britain has no interest in continuous meddling in internal Irish issues. Our decision today is likely to determine whether or not Ireland will see a return to stability or if instability will turn to chaos."

Local Irish onlookers gazed on in horror as seemingly a repeat of the Easter Rising took place.\n\nIn many towns and cities IRB elements refused to surrender and running gun battles erupted across busy streets, with numerous casualties on both sides. The conflict continued well into the night as fighting raged ferociously in Cork and Dublin. It was not until some time after dusk that the remaining IRB cells finally surrendered after more British reinforcements were called in.\n\nEarly reports indicate that the IRB leadership was tipped off by Irish locals working in the civil service who noticed new troop reinforcements flooding the region in preparation for what we have termed 'Operation Sabre'.\n\nWith the fighting over an uneasy peace has settled over Ireland. Many citizens are furious at British troops once more being deployed to major town and cities, but loyalists to Britain are simply happy that the IRB has once and for all been dealt with, their leadership having been either imprisoned or killed during the fighting."

Rumours swirl of IRB infiltration at the top of Royal Intelligence Services in Ireland, with many formerly trust-worthy agents now under suspicion. Truthfully we may never find where the leak originated from, but we will have to deal with the consequences.\n\nThe IRB now knows we are closing on them and rapidly, after one close-call they may resort to rash acts over the coming months, we must be on our guard."

Many local Irish barely noticed the efforts of the RIC until the IRB leadership was carted out in cuffs to be transported for imprisonment once again.

As RIC units stormed several locations across the nation they found nothing, the IRB leadership having fled in advance. Despite this failure it would have been far worse had we opted to use our Armed Forces to crush the IRB.\n\nWith the IRB in hiding, it remains to be seen what will come of the organisation. Many Intelligence experts believe the IRB will bide their time opting to wait for a more sutiable opportunity to once again cause havoc in Ireland in an attempt to eject us from Ireland once and for all.

Some rather bright young individuals in Intelligence quickly recognised a pattern that they had seen elsewhere in these attacks, it was very similar in the method used by the IRB during the Easter Rising of 1916.\n\nAs of this moment the IRB has seized numerous important Government buildings across Ireland, and de-seated many of our local military units in the West and South parts of the nation, effectively handing direct control over to the IRB. Military Units in Dublin are current engaged in defending against a large, but under-equipped, IRB force while more of the British Army rallies in the North and East of Ireland.\n\nAs of this moment the Second IRB Rising is on-going. If we are to ensure control over Ireland and our continued influence over this important strategic position we must crush this rebellion quickly, lest other Great Powers use this opportunity to further weaken our position."
uk.65.a: "We must retain control of Ireland!"
uk.66.t: "Stability in Ireland"
uk.66.d: "It has been one year to the day since Royal Irish Constabulary units stormed several IRB cells across Ireland and successfully captured and imprisoned the IRB leadership pending trial. Since that time an uneasy peace descended over the Irish isles, but it has been followed by a sense of stability.\n\nIRB attacks have stopped, their remaining members going into hiding, and Irish civilians seem to be satisfied with how the situation was handled, without overwhelming force by the British Armed Forces, and without more blood on the streets. For now, Ireland seems content to accept the Status Quo as nominally part of Britain, but with a degree of autonomy. Whether or not this feeling will continue indefinitely is unknown, but for now at least the independence movement in Ireland has been dealt a serious blow."
uk.66.a: "Peace, but for how long?"
uk.67.t: "Ireland and the United Kingdom"
uk.67.d: "With Westminster's efforts directed at granting independence to Ireland and officially separating it from direct control from London many changes have taken place across the Irish isles. A Parliament building has been established, and Irish citizens have began in earnest to debate the future of Ireland as a nation. It comes to us however, to determine the future relationship between our two nations as Ireland readies itself to join the world as a nation reborn.\n\nMany hawkish MPs in our Government have suggested that we cannot allow Ireland itself to drift further from our sphere of influence, and that while increased autonomy from London is necessary, we must draw the line so that Ireland will remain an ally of Britain. Simply put, we will direct our efforts to maintaining political control over Irish matters indirectly. There are also those within our Government that suggest that we should instead follow through on our promises; granting full independence to Ireland and allow them to choose their own path, whether it be with ourselves and the Empire or on their own, this choice being the height of liberty and freedom a nation can achieve.\n\nWhatever path we choose a new dawn is breaking over the Ireland and Britain, and the choice we make today will determine the relationship our two nations will have in the decades to come."
uk.67.a: "Ireland must be controlled indirectly through Westminster"
uk.67.b: "Ireland shall be granted full independence"
uk.68.t: "Peace Negotiations"
uk.68.d: "As our calamitous defeat in Ireland has sent shockwaves throughout our nation, the Provisional Irish Government has only gained in strength and international recognition. With the entirety of the Irish Isles now under their control they have pursued diplomatic channels with our nation in an effort to bring the war to and end.\n\nTheir demands are simple; the Irish Isles will be recognised as an independent republic free from British rule and the war between our two nations will come to an end. Our Government has laughed at such flagrant demands and plans are already in motion for the recapture of Ireland. Though some believe that perhaps after all these centuries the effort of controlling Ireland is simply no longer worth it."
uk.68.a: "Fully accept their terms"
uk.68.b: "We will never negotiate with these petty rebels!"
uk.69.t: "British Reply"
uk.69a.d: "Much to the surprise of our nation the British Government has accepted our demands for peace and has formally requested negotiations over the peace deal between our two nations, with Westminster recognising that Ireland will from now on be an independent republic free from British control."
uk.69b.d: "The foolish British have refused our generous demand for peace between our two nations. Citing that Ireland 'will and forever be part of the United Kingdom' they have severed diplomatic back-channels between our two nations and made thinly veiled threats about future attempts to recapture our nation. We must prepare ourselves for the attack that is surely to come."
uk.69.a: "Freedom at last!"
uk.69.b: "Our troops will soon march through London's streets!"
uk.70.t: "Industrial Sabotage in Ireland!"
uk.70.d: "Today there was an attack on one of our industrial centres in Ireland. The terrorist organisation known as the Irish Republican Brotherhood has claimed the attack as one of their own. There have been no fatalities as a result of the attack, but some people are reported to have been seriously injured."
uk.70.a: "Blast!"
uk.71.t: "Irish Railroad Bombing"
uk.71.d: "Those vile terrorists in the Irish Republican Brotherhood have today claimed a bombing attack on a major Irish Railway as their own. Two people have been reportedly killed with several others having sustained serious injuries. This attack has also put severe strain on the train lines in the region, causing major delays to both Passenger and Freight travel, as well as hindering movement of our military throughout the region."
uk.71.a: "Fools!"
uk.72.t: "The Brotherhood Targets the RIC!"
uk.72.d: "Horrifying news has been reported today, as IRB members have been seen attacking and injuring members of the Royal Irish Constabulary. As of yet, no officers have thankfully been killed, but some have sustained serious injuries. These attacks are a threat to our control of Ireland, as we rely heavily on the RIC to deal with insurgent action and protests peacefully to prevent escalation. The Irish are now killing themselves."
uk.72.a: "They're just doing their job!"
uk.80.t: "Negotiations with Rebel Leaders"
uk.80.d: "As the revolt in India spirals quickly out of control, it has become clear to both our Government and the British Army Chief of General Staff that this rebellion will take a significant amount of time, equipment and manpower to put down efficiently, and even then we may not succeed. With this in mind several members of the House of Commons have put forward a proposal to force the Government to negotiate with the rebel leaders in an attempt to bring this rebellion to an end.\n\nThe proposals specify that Westminster will guarantee that Indian Autonomy will be increased at the upcoming Imperial Conference in 1937, and that a long-term plan for the total withdrawal of British troops from India will be put in place. Such a proposal is of course utterly ridiculous, but it may serve to placate those rebel leaders until such a time as we are more adequately prepared to deal with problem."
uk.80.a: "Propose a diplomatic solution"
uk.80.b: "They will suffer the same fate as all those who rebel against the Empire"
uk.81.t: "British Proposals"
uk.81.d: "This morning a British Officer was found near the front-line in Western Bengal, apparently having approached a local militia position waving a white flag. While at first several of our Militia were elated at the possibility of British surrender, it seems the Officer was simply a messenger to deliver a note to the leaders of our rebellion. The note details a British proposal that they will grant increased autonomy for India at the Imperial Conference in 1937 and put forward plans for a total withdrawal of British troops from India in the long-term. Many within our leadership are sceptical that the British would actually follow through with such an agreement, but our military commanders are keen to remind us that while we have the advantage for the moment the British may soon bring the full wrath of the Empire down upon us, and that should they do so our revolt will surely be crushed."
uk.81.a: "Very well, we will see what British guarantees are worth"
uk.81.b: "Trusting the British will only lead to misery."
uk.82.t: "Indian Rebels Refused our Offer"
uk.82.d: "Early this morning an Indian rebel delegation was received in Hyderabad to discuss the proposal put forward by our Government in recent days. The leaders made several ridiculous demands including an immediate withdrawal of British troops from India or they would 'liberate every square inch of India forcefully'. It seems there is no reasoning with these fools."
uk.82.a: "Then we will crush those rebel scum!"
uk.83.t: "The British are driven from India!"
uk.83.d: ""
uk.83.a: "We have won our freedom!"
uk.84.t: "Indian Rebels Accept"
uk.84.d: "Our proposal for peace has been accepted by the rebel leaders in India. Apparently they were not as confident in their objectives as we were led to believe."
uk.84.a: "We must prepare ourselves for another possible rebellion"
uk.85.t: "Order Restored"
uk.85.d: "With our victory over the rebel forces a semblance of stability has returned to India, though many troubles still remain. In the coming years more challenges will appear, and we must forever stand at the ready to face them head on."
uk.85.a: "Victory at last."
uk.88.t: "The Raj Government flees to Ceylon"
uk.88.d: "With the newly independent Indian nation in a state of total collapse the former administrators of the Raj have fled to Ceylon and set up a new administration on the island. While they do not openly lay claim to the Indian sub-continent, we may find them useful at a later date once we officially restore order to India."
uk.88.a: "Establish their new capital in Colombo"
uk.90.t: "National Coal Strike 1938"
uk.90.d: "Despite our efforts to appease the strikers of Manchester just last year, it appears yet another national strike has been called by the Miners’ Federation. Coal miners across the whole nation are on strike meaning little to no coal is being mined. While we do have vast reserves, they shall not last us too long. Thankfully, there is a purpose to this strike: the strikers demand we provide welfare payments to the unemployed. Accepting these demands would incur high costs to our already shattered economy, but our nation is highly dependent on coal still and so allowing this strike to continue is sure to have dire consequences later down the line."
uk.90.a: "Ignore this rabble"
uk.90.b: "Very well, give in to their demands"
uk.91.t: "Coal Shortages Nation-Wide"
uk.91.d: "Just as feared, our coal reserves are running dangerously low. There are now areas of the nation entirely without coal because of how cold this winter has been, meaning there has been an unusually high need for said coal that we have burnt our way through. This shortage has led to a large amount of unrest and protests demanding we end this strike within certain regions of the country."
uk.91.a: "Confound those strikers!"
uk.92.t: "King Edward VIII visits Coal Strikers"
uk.92.d: "His royal majesty King Edward VIII, has today visited the one of the coal mines on strike and has spoken openly about his sympathy with the miners and those affected by the shortages. Such a move has severely damaged our government’s legitimacy as even our King doubts our policies!"
uk.92.a: "Isn't he supposed to stay out of politics!?"
uk.93.t: "Coal Riots"
uk.93.d: "The unrest in within regions of our country due to the shortage of coal has reached a critical level, once again many areas of the nation are paralysed by rioting of angry mobs of citizens calling for the Government to take affirmative action to solve the coal shortage. It is vital we take action soon, or else this situation shall only worsen if it carries on much longer."
uk.93.a: "We can't give in to the mob"
uk.94.t: "December Deaths"
uk.94.d: "A dire and unfortunate consequence of this coal shortage, during such a cold winter, is the gruesome fact of people freezing and ultimately dying from the cold. The number of deaths has been truly staggering, and many have once again gone straight to blaming us and our failure to resolve the issue as being the culprits of these deaths. Such an assertion is of course ridiculous, one must place blame on the strikers!"
uk.94.a: "Blame the strikers, not the Government!"
uk.95.t: "The Coal Strike Ends"
uk.95.d: "After a gruelling and freezing cold winter, we have stood strong and have come out of the other side of these shortages and strikes. Once again, the strikers have capitulated and gone back to their work and once again the coal shall be mined and the people shall no longer suffer at the hands of selfish Socialist ideas, breaking their access to the warmth and heat they so desperately needed during this past winter. The cost for this strike was the lives of many civilians, and I hope those who went on strike know that they are truly the ones to blame for their deaths. We may accept some of the blame, but the majority rests of the shoulders of the selfish miners and their demands!"
uk.95.a: "We will not be intimidated by an unruly mob!"
uk.100.t: "Fate of the Trade Unions"
uk.100.d: "As the Manchester Workers Crisis gripped the country, one thing was for certain: without the backing of the Trade Unions it surely would not have reached the heights that it did. Their treasonous support for radicals intent on bringing harm to the British people must not be forgiven.\n\nThe King has ordered a review into the purpose of the Trade Unions in our nation. Some of the more 'extreme' members of the Privy Council have begun advocating for the complete dissolution of the Trade Unions entirely to ensure they never again wield the power they once did. As a man or reason, the King is inclined to hear all sides over this issue, and perhaps by creating a state-led Trade Union we may control this power for ourselves and assist in alleviating the burdens of the common man."
uk.100.a: "Abolish them entirely"
uk.100.b: "Dissolve other Trade Unions and establish a single state-led Union"
uk.100.c: "Allow them to continue operating unimpeded"
uk.101.t: "Role of the Aristocracy"
uk.101.d: "As the King ascended to his rightful position as Head of our Nation the aristocracy supplied some of his most significant backers. Today they have requested that the King look into the role of the aristocracy in our nation, with many of these individuals craving power for themselves.\n\nAt the top of these proposals is allowing the aristocrats to manage regions in the Isles through local councils, loyal to the King himself of course, but capable of autonomy in certain affairs. Rightly derided as an attempt to revive feudalism in Britain, few take these proposals seriously, but the gain they could bring is perhaps enough to consider the idea after-all."
uk.101.a: "These roles are ceremonial and will remain as such"
uk.101.b: "Loyalty to the King is paramount, otherwise they may do as they wish"
uk.102.t: "Faith in our Nation"
uk.102.d: "One of the King's most vocal supporters in recent months has been the Church of England. Recognising his great contribution to maintaining the status quo in Britain and acting as a bulwark against radicalism and unwanted change in our nation, the Church has thrown in their lot with the Monarchy. The King is himself a religious man, but is perhaps not as devout as amny suspect. In the coming days he has made notice that he will decide the future of the Church of England and its relation to the Government."
uk.102.a: "The Church and Crown are indivisable"
uk.102.b: "Secularism is the path to progress"
uk.103.t: "The Household Guard"
uk.103.d: "Established during the mid 17thC, the Household Cavalry Guards have played a significant role throughout British history in their guardianship of the Monarchy. Acting as an integral part of the King's intervention and resumption of power over the Kingdom, the Household Guard have since had their duties expanded greatly to ensure order.\n\nSeveral of the Commanders of this prestigious force have since approached the King and asked him to consider the expansion of the Household Cavalry Guard to ensure their efficiency in defending the King and his family. Behind closed doors some of the Commanders have hinted that they would like to see additional powers be granted to them to root out treasonous elements of British society. In the name of the King, of course."
uk.103.a: "The powers of the Household Guard must be expanded and built upon"
uk.103.b: "Just increase their numbers"
uk.103.c: "The current situation is more than suitable"
uk.104.t: "The Privy Council"
uk.104.d: "Since the King's resumption of power the Privy Council has expanded greatly in size and in the influence that it wields. Before the Crisis it was filled with sycophantic yes-men who only wished to line their own pockets, but has since come to include men of Officers of the Armed Forces, Clergymen and Aristocrats. The King has now transfixed his gaze upon the Privy Council's composition, and an important decision is soon to be made regarding what sort of men he should look to for advice in running the nation."
uk.104.a: "Add members of the Armed Forces to the Council"
uk.104.b: "Stack the Council with members of the House of Lords"
uk.105.t: "Destiny"
uk.105.d: "Stability, peace, order and justice once more reign across Britain. Through the King's guiding hand Britain has escaped the death throes of revolution and emerged stronger than ever. Like rats setting upon a carcass however, the democratic politicians of the country have begun to emerge from their holes and speak of the King returning power to Parliament. All is forgiven they say, that the King simply used his royal prerogative to ensure Britain's safety. The King is however open to this overtures, as he is taken by the image of him being the 'saviour' of Britain and its people. Surely he must recognise the importance of his position, and that stability only exists due to his rule, and everything we have fought for will surely evaporate if he relinquishes control to those who brought us to the brink of disaster."
uk.105.a: "With the crisis over the King will once more cede power to Parliament"
uk.105.b: "The King must rule his kingdom"
uk.106.t: "The Order of the Crown"
uk.106.d: "With the King once more establishing himself as guardian of the nation, the question has arisen as to who guards the King. As such a group of prominent patriots and monarchists have established a new Knighthood Order, the Order of the Crown, with the blessing of the King himself. Tasked with the defence of the King and his family, and in many ways acting similarly to the Household Cavalry Guard, the Order of the Crown will in many ways act as an security organisation equivalent to MI5, but with the Monarchy's protection at the top of their objectives."
uk.106.a: "Never will the King be overthrown"
uk.107.t: "The King on the March"
uk.107.d: "Gravely concerned with the events occurring in the homeland during the Manchester Worker's Crisis, many of the Dominions were beset with worry that we would fall to radicalism. As stability once more has returned to Britain, the King has set out to tour the Empire and reassure those doubters that Britain has never been stronger than she is at this moment.\n\nStarting in Canada, the King will travel the width of the country by train, visiting many of the important cities along the way. Upon reaching Vancouver he will travel to New Zealand's capital for a week's stay before continuing on to Australia where he will meet with representatives of the Dominions personally and consult with them over the future of the Empire. Once concluded he will travel to the Raj, touring Calcutta before meeting the Governor-General in the Viceroy's House in New Delhi to discuss improving worker's conditions in the colony. Finally he will travel to South Africa and visit Pretoria before journeying to Cape Town where he will embark on a Royal Navy Battleship which will travel up the East Coast of Africa, and through the Suez Canal back to Britain.\n\nAn extensive trip, but one that is sure to improve morale throughout the Empire after this recent crisis."
uk.107.a: "Only through unity will our way of life be preserved"
uk.110.t: "Churchill's Speech"
uk.110.d: "''It is with great pride and commitment to my country and its people that I shall lead this brave nation forward with all the strength our nation harbours. Never again shall such terrible events as those that happened in Manchester ever plague this country again. Under my leadership all voices shall be heard, all ideas shall be observed! We shall create a truly great nation, and an even greater Empire!''\n\nThese were the words of - former Colonel, now General - Jack Churchill, who after observing recent weeks of chaos in our nation stepped in with support of the Armed Forces to restore order to Britain. The military intervention has saved this country from a collapse into the deathly arms of Collectivism, we must therefore thank the honourable men of the High Command and seek to repair the divisions created by this attempted revolution. It is time to rebuild Britain and safeguard her people from evil ideologues."
uk.110.a: "Britain must be protected from revolutionary elements"
uk.111.t: "The BARB"
uk.111.d: "One thing has become clear in these past months following the end of the Manchester Worker's Crisis: the crisis would never have been able to reach the height that it did without interference from known provocateurs. The failure of the democratic governments preceeding our own rule are clear; they willingly allowed subversive elements to roam free on the streets of Britain and sow the seeds of discord in our nation, in order to secure ourselves from the possibility of further calamity we must establish a new organisation to root out the machiavellian elements of our great nation who only wish to see it destroyed.\n\nChurchill has thus far been careful to move forward with reforms to prevent further unrest, but he has placed special interest in the creation of the British Anti-Revolutionary Brigade (BARB) to secure our new Government and protect Britain from further harm. Poised to begin operations in a week's time, the BARB is comprised of mainly ex-military men whose loyalties are unquestionable. Today Jack stands at the ready to sign the BARB into law."
uk.111.a: "Establish this new organisation and give them leave to defend Britain from traitors within"
uk.111.b: "MI5 is more than adequate to carry out our defence"
uk.112.t: "Education Reforms"
uk.112.d: "Churchill has proven himself significantly as a leader of Britain since taking power, not only with his command of the administration and willingness to impose swift justice against Britain's enemies, but also in his ability to see the bigger picture. Foremost of these is his criticism of Britain's current educational system which he regards as a serious contributory factor and root cause of the Manchester Worker's Crisis. Arguing that the schools are filled to the brim with radicals pouring poisonous lies into the minds of the British youth.\n\nOne of Jack's primary focus' in the past weeks has to been to devise a new plan for education for the British people, starting with a blanket reform of the current educational standards. Placing an emphasis on the rigours of physical training, patriotism to the State and people, as well as the importance of discipline these new reforms are likely to shake-up the entire educational system, with some comparing the proposals to the Spartan training methods of Ancient Greece. No doubt these new 'methods' are likely to bring a significant backlash from the British public in some regards, but Jack argues that the future of the British nation is at stake and with these new reforms the British youth will be armed and prepared to face revolution wherever it is found."
uk.112.a: "Like the Spartans of Ancient Greece the future generations will be trained"
uk.112.b: "We have no business interfering in the affairs of education"
uk.113.t: "Royal Army Reforms"
uk.113.d: "At the core of Churchill's proposals are plans to reinvigorate the British Army and bring it to the front as the defender of Britain. Strangled in recent years by incompetent politicians and their blatant ineptitutde, the British Army must be remade from within so that it can be stronger than ever before. Consulting with Generals of the Great War, Churchill has put together a package of reforms and funding that will significantly shake-up the British Army and make it the fighting force it was destined to be.\n\nInside these reforms lay several smaller clauses, most notably of which is a new handbook designed for the Infantryman of the British Army. Titled 'On Combat and the Nature of War', the pamphlet has been written by Jack Churchill himself, and pushes for a renewed emphasis being placed upon honour and gallantry in combat. The book begins not with an introduction but with a single quote: ''Any soldier who goes into action without his sword is improperly dressed.''."
uk.113.a: "Jack's reforms will pave the way to victory"
uk.113.b: "The Royal Army is not in need of reform"
uk.114.t: "Industrial Leadership Arrives"
uk.114.d: "As the military leadership took rightful control over the governing of our fair nation, many of the old Government archives were investigated for material deemed excessively radical, and their creators placed on watch-lists. Of this material one particular plan was made note of by our current administration, labelled simply as Plan J by its previous owner, it advocated for the rapid mobilisation of British industry to meet war demands once it became clear that the Empire was on the path to conflict with another nation.\n\nOstensibly created in response to the dire predicament the Government of our nation found itself in during the opening years of the Great War, several important industrial leaders of our nation have already been made aware of Plan J and were scheduled to update the Government yearly on their planned preparations. Of these scheduled yearly updates, this year's appraisal was to occur within a week's time. With Jack's renewed interest in the mobilisation of Britain to defend itself against foreign invasion he has ordered the Industrial leadership of Britain to be summoned to Parliament to meet with him directly. It is expected that Churchill will give the order for Britain's industries to be placed on a 'heightened state of alert' to prepare for future conflict."
uk.114.a: "Britain's industries must be prepared for war"
uk.114.b: "Those who prepare for war only serve to seek it out"
uk.115.t: "The Future of Britain"
uk.115.d: "With our rule secure over the Government and order imposed on Britain's fair isles once more the time has arrived for us to determine the future of our nation and people. Military leaders have been meeting with Churchill regularly over the course of the past week as they attempt to flesh out a deal on what should be done with the current governing system, with many arguing that while the current military-rule brings stability to Britain that it cannot last forever. Their critics argue that allowing Britain to embrace democracy once more would only abdicate our responsbility to defend Britain from further harm, and that we have a moral obligation to continue to rule indefinitely. A man not noted for patience, Churchill has curiously stood by and let both sides argue it out for days, that was, until this morning.\n\nAs the leadership met once more to discuss what Britain's path should be, Jack placed forward his own proposals for Britain's political future. To ensure stability, order and justice in the coming years, the democratic system would be returned to Britain, but would be reformed significantly. Chiefly among these reforms would be that only those who had served the Armed Forces of Britain would be allowed to vote in any elections or run for political office. Simply referred to as 'citizens' this new class would decide the future of Britain, and weed out those who would be unfit for holding political office in the first place. Derided by some of the leadership as simply mad, others have been intrigued by the idea, and it may be the best way to solve the dispute once and for all."
uk.115.a: "The Military leadership must safe-guard Britain"
uk.115.b: "Those who prove willing to make the ultimate sacrifice may gain the privilege of citizenship"
uk.116.t: "Breaking the Admiralty"
uk.116.d: "As part of Churchill's British Army reforms new measures would have to be put in place regarding the prominence of the Royal Navy over the British Army in the defence of Britain. While Churchill recognised the enormous contribuion of the Royal Navy over the past centuries in the defence of Britain's shores, he firmly believes that it is the Royal Infantryman that will ultimately decide whether Britain lives or dies, whether it is on the fields of the home isles or in war overseas.\n\nAs such Jack has put forward new laws that will weaken the Royal Navy somewhat and transfer some of the technical resources available to the Admiralty to the command of the British Army, as well as the transfer of academics responsible for research into naval development to areas more useful to the British Army.\n\nFlatly opposed by the Admiralty, and likely to significantly harm our ability to modernise our Navy in the short term, it will provide a much needed injection to the British Army."
uk.116.a: "The Royal Army must be given prominence"
uk.116.b: "The Royal Navy has defended Britain for centuries, and that is how it shall remain"

uk.130.a: "I'll sure do!"
uk.140.t: "Attlee Loses Popularity"
uk.140.d: "It has been barely a month since our new Government formed between Labour and the ILP and already things have begun to destabilise. Angered by Clement Attlee's willingness to compromise with our party, several hard-liners of his party have begun calling for his removal. This situation would normally be ignored as the simple bickering of the back benchers, but instead is noted by the marked silence of his supporters.\n\nSo far the only MP who has stood tall to defend Attlee's position has been the young Oswald Mosley, current Chancellor of the Exchequer. It remains to be seen whether this support will hold up to the continued assault by angry MPs in the coming weeks."
uk.140.a: "This does not bode well for our new Government"
uk.141.t: "Call for ILP Leadership Elections"
uk.141.d: "Rumours swirl in the halls of Westminster as MPs belonging the Independent Labour Party have held a series of closed-door meetings in recent weeks. Apparently unwilling to allow this sort of foul play to affect the running of the Government, Prime Minister Greenwood has reached out to Mosley to speak with the dissenters in an attempt to limit their destabilising actions and bring order to the Government.\n\nWhile the Prime Minister did not expect to see these issues ended overnight, he was deeply troubled by the report from Mosley once he had returned. Supposedly the rebel MPs belonging to his party have garnered enough support to push for a vote of no confidence over Attlee's leadership of the party. The results are likely to become public in the next two weeks."
uk.141.a: "And who will replace Mr. Attlee?"
uk.142.t: "Mosley is Victorious"
uk.142.d: "As expected, the vote of no confidence took place secretely between ILP MPs and has resulted in the ousting of Attlee. While many were concerned about the potential instability in our Government until the ILP found a new leader, a fresh leadership election was apparently called almost immediately after the no confidence vote, a demand made specifically by Mosley.\n\nUp until this point we had reason to believe that Oswald had been a firm supporter of Attlee for pragmatic reasons, but it appears they were purely selfish political motives. While in public Mosley was endorsing Attlee as leader of the ILP, in secret he was the one pushing for the vote of no confidence while simulataneously positioning himself to be the next leader of the ILP. With no other clear candidate to take over, and with many of our own MPs concerned about instability in the Government, we have had no choice but to accept the new turn of affairs much to our own chagrin."
uk.142.a: "This sort of skullduggery is not fit for politics!"
uk.143.t: "Changing Allegiances"
uk.143.d: "Since the rise of Mosley to power in the ILP rapid changes have begun taking place within the party with the purpose being to centralise power to Mosley's position. More worringly, several of the more 'radical' members of our party have in recent days been meeting with Mosley in private, with many suspecting attempts to sway them to the ILP side in an effort to topple our control over the coalition, and instead place it in the hands of Mosley and the ILP.\n\nFor now these rumours are just that, rumours, but many of our party are growing increasingly worried about the aggressive acts by the Chancellor of the Exchequer, and whose new-found power has led him to call for bolder and bolder reforms each week."
uk.143.a: "Tell the Party Whip to get his act together!"
uk.144.t: "Greenwood's Accident"
uk.144.d: "Late last night, the Prime Minister sat alone in his office finishing up important Government work well into the night. Having not spoken to Mosley for almost a week, many believed he was drafting a letter in an attempt to patch up poor relations between himself and his Chancellor of the Exchequer.\n\nAs Greenwood continued on into the dark night, he consumed his late night tonic in an effort to stay awake. It would not take long before his mouth ran dry and his heart felt pain from the crushing feeling in his chest. An hour after he lay sprawled unconscious on the carpeted floor of his office."
uk.144.a: "His secretary discovers his body and rushes him to hospital."
uk.144.b: "His body is found in the morning, heart failure is suspected cause of death."
uk.145.d: "Due to the diligent actions of his secretary, the PM has in recent weeks been recovering slowly in hospital after what Doctors have diagnosed as heart failure. While the cause is still unknown, many have suspected that the recent stressful weeks of inside the Government led to the accident.\n\nSurprisingly one of his first visitors was the man he had not spoken with in weeks, Chancellor Mosley. Appearing early into his recovery Mosley approached the PM and offered him his promises that the ILP would ceaase attempts to upset the political status quo inside the Government, and instead act in the benefit of the people of Britain."
uk.145.t: "The PM's Hospital Recovery"
uk.145.a: "At least this bad business is over"
uk.146.d: "With the death of the PM, a vacuum of power has emerged inside the Labour Party and Government as a whole. Rebel MPs within our Party have continuously thwarted efforts to select a new leader of the Party to replace the late Arthur Greenwood. More worringly is the news that many high-profile MPs within Labour have been meeting with Mosley in order to discuss the possibility of defecting to the ILP, as they are concerned over the lack of clarity in our Party's rule over the nation. Such a change would likely have severe ramifications for our Government, if enough MPs switch to the ILP it is likely to put the balance of power further into the hands of Mosley."
uk.146.t: "Labour Defectors"
uk.146.a: "Crows! Vultures! Rats!"
uk.147.t: "A New Prime Minister"
uk.147.d: "Early this morning Mosley appeared in the Commons to make a statement regarding recent political developments within both Labour and the ILP. Speaking of his concern regarding the instability in the Government, and his willingness to do whatever was necessary to ensure its continued existence, he announced that some three dozen MPs from our Party would join the ILP in the coming weeks.\n\nOur worst fears have been realised, while Labour is still formally in a coalition with the ILP, our power has been significantly weakened and therefore our ability to push for reforms that we choose. What's more, many expect this to continue in the coming weeks as more MPs cross over to the ILP in an attempt to stay relevant. Plummeting opinion polls have shown deep disfavour for our Government, with only Mosley remaining relatively unscatched by the entire affair. With his new position as head of the largest party in the coalition Government Mosley has moved forward with a cabinet reshuffle and been made the new Prime Minister by majority vote in Parliament."
uk.147.a: "In this period of history, change is necessary"
uk.148.t: "The Tuesday Speech"
uk.148.d: "One week has passed since the now Prime Minister Mosley took power over our new Government. Rapidly, change is beginning to be felt within the halls of Westminster. Politicians and civil servants run busily through its corridoors as new orders are passed down almost every hour by the new PM. Despite the circumstances of his victory, many have found themselves at least content that the past instability is now over. Though many were concerned about Mosley's plans for the Government in the future, their fears were allayed this morning as the PM took to Parliament to hold a live radio broadcast to the nation.\n\nSpeaking of the great task ahead of the British people in both securing their destiny and in allaying their current problems in the wake of the London Stock Market Crash, Mosley reassured those within our Government and country that the path this Government is on is the correct path to ensure the prosperity and peace of Britain and its Empire. Lambasting previous Governments for their failure to adequately predict the rhythm of this new age, he called upon Britons everywhere - regardless of their political inclinations - to work for the benefit of all of Britain, to ensure that their countrymen receive the quality of life that this new age allows, and that they deserve."
uk.148.a: "Together in Britain we have lit a flame that the ages shall not extinguish."
uk.149.d: "While our Government has remained relatively stable and free of the typical criticism that is weakly thrown at it by the Opposition, we have with our actions made an opponent of the King himself. Angered by the apparent rapid change made by our Government and the strides towards true socialism that we have promised the people of Britain, King Edward VIII has spoken at length in public to denounce the actions of Mosley and our Government. This exchange of words has only continued as Mosley has accused many of what he calls 'reactionaries' of inhibiting progress in our nation.\n\nIt is unlikely that these two men will ever see eye-to-eye, and this exhcange of comments is likely to be a hallmark of our Government in the years to come."
uk.149.t: "Mosley and the King Clash"
uk.149.a: "Progress cannot be hindered by the decrepit institutions of old!"
uk.150.t: "Overcoming the Lords"
uk.150.d: "Long a staunch adversary in preventing Mosley from passing needed reforms, the House of Lords has been particularly effective in delaying all of our new legislation in recent weeks. The Prime Minister has since considered plans in coordination with his cabinet for a proposed House of Lords reform, where the new Upper House would be representative, rather than hereditary in nature. Such reforms are likely to see strong opposition from entrenched and outdated politicians, but will likely see a modicum of support among the British populace. Whatever our choice, the reality is that the status quo cannot continue."
uk.150.a: "Further limit the power of the House of Lords through new legislation"
uk.150.b: "Let us establish a representative Upper House"
uk.151.t: "Mosley Moves to Cement His Power"
uk.151.d: "With the newly reformed Upper House being moved towards being representative, we have seen a fresh wave of elections take place across the British Isles to fill these new democratic positions. The Government's first real litmus test on how the public perceives their actions in recent months, the results have been beyond expectation. The ILP has gained a complete majority in this new Upper House, returning well beyond half the total number of seats, with its current coalition partner barely receiving a dozen positions.\n\nThese results have allowed Mosley to further restructure our Government to consolidate power unto himself and the ILP, thereby strengthening our position greatly over the Governemnt."
uk.151.a: "Firm control over the new Upper House will ensure our power"
uk.152.t: "Subjugating Labour"
uk.152.d: "Labour is but a shadow of its old self. Ever since the death of the late Arthur Greenwood and the defection of dozens of MPs to the ILP, Labour has floundered and struggled with in-fighting, they do however still maintain a strong hold over our Government and as such Mosley has recently met with his closest political allies to discuss his choices.\n\nIn order to further control our Government and the direciton that it takes, Mosley has decided to move forward with a secretive plan that will place ILP-aligned ministers into greater positions of power in the Labour Government. While still nominally a democratic decision, these new influential members of Labour are more willing to see eye-to-eye with Mosley and his policies, and will thus allow greater cooperation for the benefit of Britons in the future."
uk.152.a: "Our socialist brothers must be shown the way."
uk.153.t: "Meeting with the Military"
uk.153.d: "Since taking power resistance to our new reforms has been shown in several departments, not least of all in the Military, where the grumbling of upper-class officers grows daily. In order to rectify this issue, Mosley has reached out to his most prominent opponents to assuage their fears over the path Britain is now taking by offering to meet them at his office in 10 Downing Street.\n\nIt remains to be seen what will exactly be discussed at this meeting, assuming the meeting takes place at all."
uk.153.a: "When they arrive, dispose of them."
uk.153.b: "Let us discuss Britain's destiny"
uk.154.t: "The Trouble with Troublemakers"
uk.154.d: "It has taken well over a day of constant discussion but Mosley has succeeded in persuading several of his opponents to his way of thinking. Trouble still remains however, as some half dozen of his staunchest critics have refused to listen to his demands, arguing that if they are to continue that they would consider strongly the possibility of resistance to Mosley's Government.\n\nShocked by these recent developments, Mosley has met with his closest allies and determined that the only course of action in response to these threats to the democratically elected Government of Britain is to deal with these traitors."
uk.154.a: "Remove the worst of them, especially that broadsword wielding idiot Churchill"
uk.155.t: "Nationalisation Program"
uk.155.d: "A policy of prime importance to Mosley and the ILP is the nationalisation of many important companies in the British Isles and across the Empire. These industries are of firm importance to Britain and her people and cannot be allowed to remain in the hands of a few profiteering fat-cats. Mosley is in agreement, the Government is in agreement, these new companies must be state-run to ensure our continued prosperity into the future."
uk.155.a: "We must see that more goods are forthcoming to meet the new demand of the modern age."
uk.156.t: "Mosley Speaks to Britain"
uk.156.d: "Late this afternoon Prime Minister Mosley held a live radio address to the people of Britain from his office at 10 Downing Street. Speaking at length of the challenges that Britons have overcome in recent months, and of the challenges that still lay ahead he congratulated the ability of Britons to adapt to the new age in which we live and to carry on as they always have.\n\nOffering a glimpse into his future plans for Britain and the Empire, Mosley argued that he would not allow Britain to be dragged into another disastrous war overseas unless Britain herself were at threat. With crisis brewing on the continent, many were relieved to hear that Britain itself would remain outside of the conflict in Europe. For now at least."
uk.156.a: "The Path of Mankind is once more illuminated"
uk.160.t: "War in Burma"
uk.160.d: "With war between ourselves and France now well underway the various colonies of both of our Empires across the globe have found themselves engulfed in the struggle between our two nations. Perhaps worst of these is our colony in Burma which we had normally relied upon the Raj Government to defend.\n\nDue to the uprising that was only recently dealt with in India we had seen fit to administer Burma directly to bring temporary stability to the region, but now with the Raj once more stable it would seem prudent to once more place Burma into their care in order to assist in the defence of the region from the threat of French Indochina."
uk.160.a: "The Raj government can assist us in defending Burma from invasion"
uk.160.b: "We can defend Burma without their assistance"
uk.161.t: "The War Economy"
uk.161.d: "Due to the requirements placed upon our nation while at war with another major power, our economic power has been mobilised for conflict against our enemies. The effects of the LSMC will be negated because of this."
uk.161.a: "We must mobilise the economy!"
uk.400.t: "The King's Commands"
uk.400.d: "Much like his father before him King Edward VIII is a strong-willed man and in many ways tirelessly stubborn. Shirking off many of the protective measures employed by the Household Guard, our new King is determined to be seen as a man of the people. Something, he says, cannot be accomplished if he has a large number of bodyguards following him around all day.\n\nAs such he has begun refusing to be seen with a significant detachment of bodyguards in public. The King's advisors have reminded him time and again that while the people may respond positively to the way he mingles among them without fear, it does place him at significant risk.\n\nWhile the King has authority on this matter and we cannot force him to agree to our whims, perhaps it would be wise to allow the normal security detachment to instead 'volunteer' to remain close by. For his protection, of course."
uk.400.a: "The King commands and we obey"
uk.400.b: "Maintain the number of bodyguards nearby, whether he likes it or not"

#AA Oil Company
ukf.1.t: "The Arabian Peninsula"
ukf.1.d: "With our eyes now cast on the Arabian peninsula and Parliament fully supportive of attempts to regain our influence over the Arabian nation, the choice has come to us to decide how it may be done. Many in our Government believe that an easier way of ensuring our control over the nation is to economically dominate it as was done in the inter-war period. As such, several of our ministers have suggested that we establish an Anglo-Arabian Oil Company. The benefits of doing so will be two-fold: firstly we will no doubt gain from any resource deposits discovered in the region, and secondly the Arabian Government will be unlikely to resist us with so much of their economy under our control. Our Government is prepared immediately to move forward with this venture."
ukf.1.a: "Justify a military incursion into the country"
ukf.1.a: "Establish the Anglo-Arabian Oil Company"
ukf.2.t: "The Anglo-Arabian Oil Company"
ukf.2.d: "With the Anglo-Arabian Oil Company officially set up our Government must now decide the level of control we will have over the company. Many within our Government believe that with such an expensive and potentially lucrative venture we must maintain total control over the company. Others believe that by sharing control with the Arabian Government we may make them more willing to give in to our own demands."
ukf.2.a: "Ensure we have total control over the company"
ukf.2.a: "Offer the Arabian Government joint-control over the company"
ukf.2.a: "British investment will only assist in our economic growth"
ukf.3.t: "Control over the Anglo-Arabian Oil Company"
ukf.3a.d: "The British Government has informed us of their decision regarding control over the Anglo-Arabian Oil Company. From now on they will maintain total control over the venture."
ukf.3b.d: "The British Government has informed us of their decision regarding control over the Anglo-Arabian Oil Company. They have decided to share control of the company with our Government in an effort to improve relations between our nations."
ukf.3.a: "This will only limit the benefits we receive from their investment"
ukf.3.b: "This way both of our nations can benefit!"
ukf.4.t: "Skirmishes near Damman"
ukf.4.d: "Barely a week has passed since the Anglo-Arabian Oil Company set up near a promising area, and already problems have begun to manifest themselves. While the Arabian Government seems more than happy to allow our continued investment into their economy, it seems they do not have total control over the tribes in the area.\n\nLate yesterday afternoon several tribal members attacked our drill site, and wounded two British citizens before absconding with important equipment. This loss of face only serves to humiliate our nation, and we must see that it does not occur again."
ukf.4.a: "Pressure the Arabian Government to give us more control over the region!"
ukf.4.b: "Demand the Arabian Government defend our drillers from further attack"
ukf.5.t: "British Pressure"
ukf.5.d: "This morning the British delegation to our Government issued a series of demands to our Government. Citing the recent skirmish in Damman where a British citizen was wounded and equipment stolen from the drill site, they have demanded that they be allowed to station soldiers in the area and cede authority to the British in the region. Faced with such a demand our King does not feel it likely that he can accept these demands and survive the political intrigue after. As such, our options are limited."
ukf.5.a: "Resign"
ukf.5.b: "Refuse their demands"
ukf.6.t: "Loyal King in Arabia"
ukf.6.d: "Unwilling to blindly accept our demands, the Arabian King has instead abdicated from his position. Using our influence over their Govenrnment we have succeeded in manuevering a more sympathetic member of the Royal Family into the position of King. He has accepted our demands over the Arabian Government and we have now found ourselves with a loyal protectorate in the region."
ukf.6.a: "Send Lawrence as our representative to the new Arabian Government"
ukf.7.t: "The Arabians Refuse"
ukf.7.d: "The Arabian Government has refused our demands that we be allowed station soldiers near Damman to defend our drilling site. With a nation such as Arabia refusing our gracious demand, there is little option left but to show the world what happens when you refuse to accept the Empire's demands."
ukf.7.a: "Punish them!"
ukf.8.t: "British Demands"
ukf.8.d: "Following the incident near Damman where a British citizen was wounded by local tribesmen and important equipment stolen from the dig site, the British Govenrment has demanded that our Government step up our efforts to defend their citizens on the ground. While this is of course possible, should we wish to try and remove British influence over our nation we can instead approach the local tribal leaders and offer them weapons as a means of stepping up attacks against the British. Such an act however, is likely to only make the British Government angrier."
ukf.8.a: "Send an extra garrison to help police the area"
ukf.8.b: "Ignore their complaints"
ukf.9.t: "Tribesmen Defeated"
ukf.9.d: "As the Arabian Government bowed to our pressure to reinforce the local garrison near our drilling site, an excursion was conducted to 'pacify' the area. Reports this morning indicate that the operation was a success and that we need no longer worry about the local tribes any longer."
ukf.9.a: "Now drilling can begin in earnest"
ukf.10.t: "Oil Drillers Killed"
ukf.10.d: "Despite our demands that the Arabian Government step up efforts to defend our drillrs from attack by local tribesmen, it has been reported to us that the local garrison has done little to assist in defence, and has according to at least one of our men on the ground, only aided those attacking the drill site. This situation reached a head this morning, as several of our oil drillers were killed in a recent raid by the tribesmen."
ukf.10.a: "Demand that the Arabian Government allow us to station our own soldiers in the area!"
ukf.11.t: "Successful Beginning"
ukf.11.d: "It has been two weeks since the Anglo-Arabian Oil Company began drilling in earnest and initial results are encouraging. Large desposits of oil have been detected, several of our drillers on the ground have enquired as to the possibility of additional funding and resources being diverted their way. They say that with the extra money they can increase the output of the oil fields significantly."
ukf.11.a: "Increase funding to the company!"
ukf.11.b: "Continue with current funding"
ukf.12.t: "Profits from the Anglo-Arabian Oil Company"
ukf.12.d: "It has been a month since the Anglo-Arabian Oil Company began its successful drilling venture, and the results have been more than we could have hoped for. Previously untapped oil has been located in major quantities throughout our nation, though our hold over the Anglo-Arabian Oil Company remains limited. As such our Government has proposed that we offer the British the Jordan and West Iraqi territories as a means of gaining additional control over the Company, and increasing the benefits it has for our nation."
ukf.12.a: "Offer them some of our poorer territory in return for greater control over the company"
ukf.13.t: "An Arabian Proposition"
ukf.13.d: "This morning the Arabian delegation in London has put forward an official proposal by their Government that would see additional control over the lucrative Anglo-Arabian Oil Company be put in their hands. In return they have offered us control over the Jordan and West Iraqi regions currently under their administration. While worthless, these territories would be useful for running our planned Cape to Calcutta railway system through, and increase our influence over the Levant."
ukf.13.a: "This land could be useful in extending our influence over the region"
ukf.13.b: "That land is worthless and they know it!"
ukf.14.t: "Britain Responds"
ukf.14a.d: "The British Government has responded to our proposal and relinquished additional control over the Anglo-Arabian Oil Company to our nation in return for our Jordanian and West Iraqi territories."
ukf.14b.d: "The British Government has refused our generous proposal for additional control over the Anglo-Arabian Oil Company in return for Jordan and West Iraq."
ukf.14.a: "Very well"

#Operation Pitcairn
ukf.35.t: "The Panama Trade"
ukf.35.d: "The Panama Canal has connected the Atlantic and Pacific oceans since 1914, making the flow of trade across the world much smoother and efficient, therefore the Canal is absolutely vital in maintaining our control over the seas. With the United States still suffering greatly from the Depression we have the perfect opportunity to take control over it.\n\nThere are two ways of gaining control over the Canal; we can either take advantage of the relatively small garrison stationed at the Panama Canal and prepare to land a contingent of Royal Marines on the canal, with orders to dislodge any American soldiers they find. Alternatively, we could also approach them with an offer to buy the Canal thus keeping us in good stead with the rest of the world, but costing us an enormous amount of money."
ukf.35.a: "Put plans in motion for the seizure of the Canal zone"
ukf.35.b: "Offer to buy it."
ukf.36.t: "Britain offers to buy the Panama Canal"
ukf.36.d: "The British representative in Washington today handed our Government an official proposal for the purchase of the Panama Canal. While such a suggestion would normally be disregarded entirely, as the Canal is regarded as being of strategic importance to our nation, there are some within our Government who are voicing interest in the agreement as a means of alleviating financial difficulties we are currently enduring due to the Great Depression."
ukf.36.a: "We shall accept the offer."
ukf.36.b: "The Panama Canal is too important"
ukf.37.t: "Washington accepts the offer!"
ukf.37.d: "Our proposal for the purchase of the Panama Canal was agreed upon this morning by the British representative in Washington and the United States' Secretary of State. In the coming days the Panama Canal will officially exchange hands and the flow of money to the US in return for the canal will begin in earnest."
ukf.37.t: "Excellent news!"
ukf.38.t: "Washington rejects the offer!"
ukf.38.d: "In a display of utter stupidity, the American Government has out-right refused to our proposal for the purchase of the Panama Canal, stating that they could not wantonly allow the canal to be given to another nation, especially given its importance to trade in the Caribbean Sea. Many within our Government are furious at the Americans unwillinginess to listen to reason, and several hawkish members are suggesting that we use the strong arm of the Royal Navy to secure the Panama Canal without American approval."
ukf.38.a: "Then we must put Plan B into motion"
ukf.38.b: "Forget about it"
ukf.39.t: "Operation Pitcairn: Initial Stage"
ukf.39.d: "With our orders in place elements of the Royal Marines and Royal Navy have gathered in Whitehall to discuss the planned seizure of the Panama Canal from the US garrison currently stationed there. Codenamed 'Operation Pitcairn' - in honour of a Royal Marines officer killed during the Battle of Bunker Hill against American rebels - the planning will take several weeks to conclude and will possibly require a greater number of men and resources before we are fully ready. Already the first issue has arisen regarding the planned operation: Royal Marine commanders are adamant that they be given a greater number of soldiers, arguing that the current numbers are barely adequate to seize a territory as large as the Panama Canal.\n\nWe are confident that the Royal Marines will be able to succeed in securing this territory with relative ease, but we should be prepared should the worst happen."
ukf.39.a: "Give the Royal Marines the additional men they have requested for the operation"
ukf.39.b: "We can spare no more for this endeavour"
ukf.40.t: "Operation Pitcairn: Reconnaissance Issues"
ukf.40.d: "Yesterday evening Royal Navy Admirals reported to operational headquarters in Whitehall that there have been several intelligence issues regarding the Panama Canal. Supposedly the garrison of the area is much larger than previously anticipated and there are several geographical issues that may impede any proposed landing by the Royal Marines. As such they have requested that our Government give the go-ahead for an additional reconnaissance sweep of the Canal Zone in oreder to gleen more relevant intelligence over the area."
ukf.40.a: "Begin reconnaissance flights over the area"
ukf.40.b: "We cannot risk alerting the Americans to our plans"
ukf.41.t: "Operation Pitcairn: Final Preparation"
ukf.41.d: "It has been just over a month since Operation Pitcairn was ordered to be put into the planning stage and the men of the Royal Navy and Marines have been working tirelessly over the course of several long days and nights to prepare our Armed Forces for the upcoming capture.\n\nPractise landings were conducted over the past month across the British Isles in preparation for the assault, and the Royal Navy has moved a squadron of their vessels to the Caribbean. The Operation is almost ready to begin, it is simply a matter of time."
ukf.41.a: "The Operation is ready to begin"
ukf.42.t: "Operation Pitcairn"
ukf.42.d: "At 5.34am local time, detachments of the Royal Marines made ground in the Panama Canal using the early morning fog to advance quickly ashore. Locals were awoken as shouts went out to half asleep American soldiers being woken from their beds and ordered to surrender in barracks across the zone.\n\nWhile initially successful firefights later erupted inland as the American garrison received orders to 'resist foreign invasion by any and all means'. Outnumbered and outgunned, the Americans fought bravely but in vain, as the guns of the Royal Navy were brought to bear on stubborn hold-outs in the territory.\n\nFighting has since ended and several hours of relative calm have passed in the Canal, with several hundred American soldiers captured. Washington has already responded with fury at our capture of the territory, stating that the '...attack represents the clearest example of renewed imperialism in the Americas by the British Empire'. It remains to be seen whether anything will come of this attack and whether or not the American government are willing to go to war over the territory."
ukf.42.a: "Pitcairn has his revenge at last"
ukf.43.t: "Operation Pitcairn"
ukf.43.d: "Early this morning as detachments of Royal Marines landed on the beaches of the Panama Canal zone they found themselves immediately set upon by a larger-than-predicted American garrison in the region, apparently alerted to our invasion far in advance.\n\nFighting bravely on the beaches of the territory, the Royal Marines - with the assistance of the Royal Navy - initially overwhelmed the defences of the American garrison before falling short of their primary objectives due to lack of supplies and poor knowledge of the local terrain. Forced into a stalemate by the American defenders the Royal Marines commanders ordered a general retreat after having captured a small port facility.\n\nThe cost of failure has been high: several hundred Royal Marines lay strewn across the Panama Canal with dozens more captured. With this loss of face our humiliation was only increased when American newspapers showed images of captured Royal Marines servicemen on their front pages."
ukf.43.a: "Blast it all!"
ukf.44.t: "Battle at the Panama Canal"
ukf.44a.d: "At roughly 6am local time, reports began to come in from the Panama Canal regarding an assault by a heavily armed and specially trained force of soldiers. While details were scarce about who the attackers were, one of our Destroyers spotted a squadron of Royal Navy vessels off the coast of the Panama Canal providing fire support for what we assume to be a contingent of Royal Marines. Despite fighting bravely, our soldiers and sailors eventually succumbed to the more well-equipped Royal Marines.\n\nThe Press were gathered at the White House earlier today and the President made a statement regarding the assault, stating unequivocally that we would not allow the British to once again bring the spectre of imperialism to the Americas. While public opinion is firmly in favour of our Government in the matter, some doubt that the public is fully behind a war with the British Empire. Whatever our response is, we must choose carefully."
ukf.44b.d: "As the dawn began to rise over the Panama Canal this morning reports began to emerge of a heavily armed force wading ashore on the beaches of the Canal zone. Alerted by the local populace, our garrison in the area quickly moved to defend the territory and caught the attackers off-guard while they were still taking the beaches. A brutal firefight ensued and for a time it seemed as though our forces were on the brink of defeat before the enemy force was bogged down by lack of supplies and poor knowledge of the terrain.\n\nThe commander in the region ordered a general counter-attack against the beleagured attackers and forced them, once more, back to the breach from whence they came. A stalemate ensued as the attacking force dug in and launched their own vicious counter-attack which our brave soldiers repelled.\n\nAs the hours moved forward, the enemy force began to thin in numbers until only a few dozen remained on the beaches and surrendered to our soldiers, revealing themselves to be Royal Marines of the British Armed Forces.\n\nSome several hundred lay dead among the Canal Zone, and our Press has made much of the attack, parading images of the captured Royal Marines on their front pages. This entire affair has been a stark humiliation for the British Government and their imperialistic attempts to seize land unlawfully in the Americas."
ukf.44.a: "Damn those British bastards"
ukf.44.b: "Lock the British out of our markets!"
ukf.44.c: "This means war!"
ukf.44.e: "You can't take Uncle Sam by surprise!"

#Channel Exercises
ukf.70.t: "Channel Exercises"
ukf.70.d: "With the worst of the London Stock Market Crash now over our focus has been turned once more to the tensions between ourselves and France, as well as the lingering possibility of open hostilities on the European mainland and overseas. The Admiralty has therefore approached the Government with plans to launch a large-scale naval exercise in the English Channel as a means of not only ensuring that the Royal Navy is up to the task of defending Britain, but also in an effort to send a message to the French that our resolve is as strong as ever."
ukf.70.a: "Instruct the Admiralty to move forward with the exercises"
ukf.70.b: "There's no need for this"
ukf.71.t: "British Naval Exercises"
ukf.71.d: "This morning the Director-General of the Deuxième Bureau met with our President to discussed the build-up of British Naval vessels inside the English Channel. While the Royal Navy regularly rotates its forces in and out of the Channel and overseas, our intelligence has reported that a far greater number of vessels has made port in Portsmouth and elsewhere along the English coast. The Deuxième Bureau believes that the British are preparing for a large scale naval exercise over the course of the next few weeks. With tensions still relatively high between our two nations the Marine Nationale has requested permission to order some French vessels to sea in the Channel as a means of observing the British naval exercises from afar to ensure they do not violate French territorial waters."
ukf.71.a: "Approve the Marine Nationale's proposals"
ukf.71.b: "Ignore these meaningless exercises"
ukf.72.t: "Naval Exercises Conclude"
ukf.72.d: "Over two weeks have passed since the Channel Exercises began and we have learned much from the state of the Royal Navy. Some flaws were detected in our naval equipment, but by-and-large are sailors performed admirably and professionally. These exercises have provided us with some invaluable experience in regards to the preparation of the Royal Navy and its ability to defend our island home."
ukf.72.a: "Excellent news"
ukf.73.t: "Marine Nationale in the Channel"
ukf.73.d: "Late yesterday evening fresh reports from Royal Navy Commanders participating in the Channel Exercises have indicated that several Royal Navy vessels are currently being shadowed by their counter-parts in the French Marine Nationale. Currently it is unknown why they have been watching our exercises so diligently. Theories range from poor attempts to spy on our navy to the more likely attempt to prevent our vessels from getting too close to French waters. Whatever the reason, it would seem that we have some unwanted observers for the rest of these exercises."
ukf.73.a: "Let them witness our might"
ukf.74.t: "HMS Triton sunk!"
ukf.74.d: "At approximately 2:56am last night during live fire exercises, HMS Triton under command of Lieutenant Commander Steel, accidentally strayed into French territorial waters during our naval exercises. Upon entering French waters it would take an hour before HMS Triton would surface and identify that they had strayed out of the combat exercise area. Final communication between the Admiralty and Lieutenant Commander Steel indicated that they were attempting to return back to international waters when they were intercepted by a French vessel. Communications were abruptly cut short, and several Royal Navy vessels were dispatched to HMS Triton's last location. When reaching the destination, a squadron of French vessels were discovered and debris belonging to HMS Triton was found floating on the water close by.\n\nSo far the French Government has refused to comment on the actions taken against our vessel and a tense stand-off between Royal Navy and Marine Nationale ships has continued well into this morning. Circumstances surrounding the sinking of HMS Triton remain ambiguous at best."
ukf.74.a: "Demand an immediate apology from the French Government!"
ukf.74.b: "Attempt to calm the situation through diplomatic channels"
ukf.75.t: "HMS Triton sunk by Le Fantasque"
ukf.75.d: "Last night one of our Destroyers - Le Fantasque - unexpectingly detected a submarine in our territorial waters. Believing it to be a vessel from the Royal Navy, and with suspicions high between our two nations, orders were dispatched to Le Fantasque to intercept the submarine and force it to surface so that it could be boarded.\n\nWhen within range of the submarine, Le Fantasque dropped several depth charges in an attempt to force the submarine to surface. The first two depth charges failed in their objective, but the third seemingly struck the submarine directly, causing a large explosion. French vessels were dispatched to the area to assist in rescuing survivors if any could be found, but the situation was only made worse by the arrival of several Royal Navy vessels to the area who immediately demanded our ships leave so that they could begin their own rescue operations.\n\nA tense diplomatic stand-off has continued between ourselves and Britain and has only been made worse by British demands for a full apology by our Government regarding the deaths of their sailors and loss of their vessel."
ukf.75.a: "Warn the British to avoid our territorial waters in the future"
ukf.75.b: "Offer the British condolences and attempt to deescalate"
ukf.76.t: "The French Government refuses to apologise"
ukf.76.d: "The demands for a full apology from the French Government to the families of those now deceased sailors aboardf HMS Triton has been refused by the French Government. Claiming that the Royal Navy had unlawfully violated French sovereignty by entering into French territorial waters, the French Government has warned us of future provocations.\n\nOur Government is in a rage over this insult to our nation and those related to the deceased, and has come up with several plans to force the French to back down further. So far only a single plan has been approved by the Admiralty: it calls for the immediate deployment of the Mediterranean Fleet in a show of force to France that we will not back down over this issue."
ukf.76.a: "Order the Mediterranean Fleet out to sea"
ukf.76.b: "This isn't worth escalating over"
ukf.77.t: "The French Government Offers Condolences"
ukf.77.d: "British diplomats in Paris today have reported back to Westminster regading meetings with the French Minister of Foreign Affairs. Offering their sincere condolences for the loss of life suffered in the now regarded tragic accident, the French Government has agreed to formally write a letter to each of those relatives of the deceased in offer of apology."
ukf.77.a: "We must ensure that this does not happen again."
ukf.78.t: "Britain Accepts"
ukf.78.d: "The British Government has this morning formally accepted our apology for the loss of life in the tragic incident between our two navies. Royal Navy vessels have once more returned to port and the Marine Nationale has removed most of its vessels from the Channel. Many are breathing the sigh of relief that this accident did not come to a further exchange of blows between the Royal Navy and Marine Nationale."
ukf.78.a: "Good that they have come to their senses"
ukf.79.t: "Royal Navy placed on alert status"
ukf.79.d: "Leaders of the Marine Nationale met with the President today along-side the Director-General of the Deuxième Bureau to discuss the new naval movements being made by the Royal Navy. Our refusal to issue an apology over the deaths of those on the British submarine has been met with silence from Westminster, but we have received reports that the British Mediterranean Fleet has left port and is heading for the coast of Algérie.\n\nMarine Nationale Admirals have therefore been instructed to deploy the necessary vessels to ward off the British threat to our nation and to send a clear message that France will not be intimidated by the presence of the Royal Navy."
ukf.79.a: "Order our ships out of port and place them on alert!"
ukf.80.t: "Battle of Mers-el-Kébir"
ukf.80.d: "At Eleven O'Clock this morning Royal Navy vessels approached French territorial waters once more, this time off the coast of Algérie, and were almost immediately met by their counter-parts in the Marine Nationale with a stand-off ensuing between the two fleets. Slightly over an hour later, a French submarine - Le Ariane -  came too close to the Royal Navy Battle Group and depth charges were dropped, causing significant damage to the vessel. Royal Navy ships in an attempt to pursue the submarine drifted inside French territorial waters, and several warning shots were exchanged between French and British vessels in the region. Le Ariane, still suffering damage from the incident exploded shortly after reaching the Marine Nationale fleet, and French commanders mis-took it for direct fire from the Royal Navy, with a battle soon developing between both sides.\n\nIt would take just a few hours before official orders from Westminster would be received by the Royal Navy Fleet to stand down all offensive operations, with the French Government sending similar orders to the Marine Nationale. Rescue operations are under-way by both sides, with some estimates of well over five hundred dead from both sides.\n\nBritish and French media have both claimed victory in this battle, though it remains to be seen if the conflict between France and Britain will escalate into war."
ukf.80.a: "Take that you French bastards!"
ukf.80.b: "Victory is ours!"
ukf.80.c: "We will not stand for this insult!"
ukf.81.d: "With rescue operations now concluded both by the Royal Navy and Marine Nationale, reports have indicated that the French fleet has once more returned to port in the region. British media has claimed victory in this conflict between our nations, with some photographs of a French Battleship on fire and sinking being plastered all over local media. Unexpectingly French media has also claimed victory in the battle, claiming that the Marine Nationale destroyed more ships in the battle than she lost, less unexpectingly however it would seem that the French Government is unwilling to escalate this further between our nations. Perhaps the most significant flash-point between our two nations since the Fashoda Incident is now over, with many relieved that open war was avoided."
ukf.81.t: "Marine Nationale returns to French ports"
ukf.81.a: "Perhaps next time they will avoid trading blows with the Royal Navy"

#The Alaskan Territories
ukf.110.t: "The British Demands Control of Alaska"
ukf.110.d: "The British Government has continued its string of renewed Imperialism in the Americas, this time by demanding the hand-over of our Alaskan territories to Canadian control. Washington, and the nation at large, is in an uproar over this blatant attempt at bullying our nation into submission. It seems we have little choice but to make the British learn the hard way that they should remain out of American affairs."

ukf.110.b: "We have no choice"
ukf.110.t: "Washington Refuses to hand over Alaska"
ukf.111.d: "The American Government has once again shown its complete ignorance of the military situation surrounding its nation, this time by refusing our quite reasonable demand to hand over their Alaskan territories to the Dominion of Canada. Our Government and people are of one mind; the Americans must be punished for refusing our demands!"

For a while it seemed that Washington was prepared to make a fight of the matter, but sensible minds prevailed and brought reason to the US Government. Alaska is ours, and with it, our dominance in North America is assured."

#Anglo-Japanese Ties
ukf.120.t: "Anglo-Japanese Ties"
ukf.120.d: "The Empire of Japan, since its restoration in 1868, has quickly become a new global power to be reckoned with. Their surprise defeat of the Russian Empire at the beginning of this century shocked many nations, but where others found disbelief, we saw a potential new ally. During the Great War, the Japanese Empire assisted our nation in defeating the Germans in Asia, and since that time we have maintained a close relation with their nation.\n\nThe time has therefore come for us to consider reinvigorating ties between our two nations by formally inviting them to our alliance."
ukf.120.t: "Invite them to join the IPA"
ukf.121.t: "Britain proposes we join the IPA"
ukf.121.d: "The British Empire has today extended a generous offer to our Government. They propose that we formalise an alliance between our two nations by joining the IPA. By doing so we will surely bring peace and stability to Asia."

#The Mountain Passes
ukf.130.t: "Securing the Mountain Passes"
ukf.130.d: "Nepal and Bhutan have long been under our sphere of influence, since the days of the East India Company right up until the modern day. However, in this time of great political change it is looking increasingly likely that the two mountain nations will drift from our influence and fall to the new powers of China and Japan.\n\nWe cannot allow this to happen, their location is vital for securing the Raj against foreign invasion or influence across China. It also provides a perfect defensive frontier against the Chinese should they choose to set their sights on our Indian holdings. Therefore we must decide on the best course of action regarding the mountain pass, do we take control of it directly or entrench our influence so that it cannot be contested?"
ukf.130.a: "Demand that Nepal and Bhutan become protectorates"
ukf.130.b: "Suggest that they become part of the Raj Government"
ukf.130.c: "Solve this with war"
ukf.131.t: "Britain demands we become a protectorate!"
ukf.131.d: "We have been delivered an ultimatum by the British: become an official protectorate of their Empire or face them on the field of battle. Their power is overwhelming and they outnumber us on an absurd scale, but if we take advantage of our terrain we may just be able to hold them off for long enough so as to keep our sovereignty."

#Cape to Cairo
ukf.150.t: "Reburial Ceremony for Cecil Rhodes"
ukf.150.d: "Cecil Rhodes, an ambitious British businessman and prominent Imperialist and a man who pushed the boundaries of colonisation by establishing the British South Africa Company in 1888. This company would go on to establish the colonies of Rhodesia and administer the lands of the Bechuanaland even to this day. A great man, whose triumphant will and national pride led him deep into the heart of Africa with the goal of expanding British control to the areas he explored. It is thanks to him that we stand as the largest Empire the world has ever seen.\n\nOne of his greatest ambitions was the idea of a Cape to Cairo Railroad, and while such an idea never came to fruition in his lifetime, it has recently been realised. As the first trains set off from the Cape on their great journey up the Dark Continent, the greatness of Cecil Rhodes has been remembered by all at his reburial ceremony in London. He has been reburied with full honours, with many great guests in attendance including the King himself who personally gave a speech about the importance of Rhodes’ work to the British.\n\n''If Rhodes were alive today, he would be overcome with joy at the extent of the modern British Empire – and if it weren’t for him, then we may never have reached such grandeur.''"

#Mesopotamia

ukf.160.d: "The Mesopotamia region is the next stepping stone in the Cape to Singapore project, their lands are vital for connecting Kuwait through to Calcutta to the line. They also harbour great reserves of oil, and thanks to the recent instability in the region we can take advantage of the turmoil and demand that they submit to our rule. The Iraqi nation is a new creation, and so it is doubtable if anyone will miss them should they disappear."
ukf.160.a: "Demand that Iraq become a protectorate"
ukf.160.b: "Solve this with war"
ukf.161.t: "Britain Demands that we become a Protectorate"
ukf.161.d: "We have been delivered demands by the British, demanding that we become a protectorate under their control. Owing to the recent instability in our nation, it might be wise for us to accept and bring in a more stable – if British – Government."

ukf.162.a: "A wise decision, old chap"
ukf.163.t: "[IRQ.GetName] Refuses"
ukf.163.d: "[IRQ.GetName] has refused our offer to become a protectorate, the instability in the region will continue and as it does it shall block our ambitions and our path into Persia. Therefore, we must secure the region no matter the cost!"

#Securing Persian Oil
ukf.165.t: "Securing Persian Oil"
ukf.165.d: "Persia is an important gateway between the Middle East and the Indian subcontinent. It also contains some of the richest oil fields in the world, oil fields that should be under the control of the Anglo-Persian. However, due to the recent political machinations within Persia our control has been greatly contested. We must therefore step in and take control of the situation ourselves, as the Iranians have clearly failed to do so. The question is though, how far do we take it?"

The Royal Navy has already been spotted near the Strait of Hormuz and a build-up of troops has been detected nearby, it seems they are genuine about their threats of war."
ukf.169.a: "Never!"

ukf.171.t: "Persia Refuses"
ukf.171.d: "It seems there is only one master of the Persian Government; insanity, as today Persian officials in London have rebuked our demand to cede their southern coast to our nation. It seems that only war is only option left to win these territories."

#Finish the Great Game
ukf.180.t: "Finishing the Great Game - Afghanistan"
ukf.180.d: "Since the early 19thC, relations between ourselves and the Russians in Central Asia have been bordering on the hostile. Both of our nations attempted to exert our own influence on the region, in what has become known as the Great Game. The Russians sought to conquer more land for their Empire, while we were only interested in defending our India territory. Today, only one nation remains independent between our two nations; Afghanistan. While useful as a buffer between ourselves and the God-less Communists that today now control the former Russian Empire, the time has come to bring Afghanistan directly under our control in order to construct a strong defence against the Soviet threat from the North. It is doubtful that the Afghanistani government will accept our generous offer, so we must be prepared for war with their nation."

ukf.180.b: "Solve this with war"
ukf.181.t: "Britain demands we become a protectorate!"

While the threat posed by the Communists is real, by becoming a protectorate of the Empire we will merely be their puppet. Is our independence worth sacrificing for a semblance of security?"

ukf.182.a: "A wise choice"
ukf.183.t: "[From.GetName] Refuses"
ukf.183.d: "It seems that our preparations for war with [From.GetName] were prudent, as today the Afghan government rejected our proposal for their nation to become a protectorate of the British Empire. It seems we will not only have to protect them from the Soviets, but also from themselves."
ukf.183.a: "Crush them!"
ukf.185.t: "Finishing the Great Game - Transcaspia"
ukf.185.d: "The Trancaspian Government's existence in Central Asia only began in the latter years of the Russian Civil War, and has since remained relatively unscathed despite internal political turmoil. Influence from our Government in the region is exceptionally strong, with the Transcaspian nation heavily reliant upon us economically. With the Collectivists to the North, securing Transcaspia would present us with the perfect opportunity to strike the Russians where they are weakest, if it becomes a necessity."

ukf.195.d: "Portuguese Monarchists forces successfully ejected their Republican opponents from the Portuguese mainland almost a year ago, forcing the Republicans into exile in Portuguese Africa. Though a stalemate developed between the two as neither side had the capacity to launch an invasion of the other's territory, that was until recently.\n\nWith the Portuguese Monarchists having consolidated power in the mainland, they have renewed the campaign against their Republican enemies by promising to liberate all Portuguese territory. With our position not only as a long-standing ally of Portugal, but also our geographical position between Portuguese Angola and Mozambique, we have several options available to us in assisting our friends in their campaign against their enemies."

#Monroe Disputes
ukf.210.t: "Britain Disputes the Monroe Doctrine"
ukf.210.d: "Grave news from London has indicated that the British Government is in the process of making a new policy statement regarding their foreign objectives in the Americas. Confirmed by the British Ambassador in Washington just this morning, we have learned that London intends to rebuke the Monroe Doctrine and inform our Government that it 'shall pursue diplomatic objectives with any country in the Americas, regardless of American feeling towards imperialism in North & South America'. Such a direct threat to our interests will only undermine what influence we have with the South American nations. In order to ensure our continued diplomatic clout in the Americas we must issue a stern response to the British."
ukf.210.a: "Warn them of the consequences of this action"
ukf.210.b: "Ignore this meaningless rhetoric"
ukf.210.c: "Threaten them with war!"
ukf.211.t: "Washington Warns Westminster"
ukf.211.d: "This morning the American Ambassador in London issued a note to our Government, stating that our planned extension of diplomatic influence in the Americas is unacceptable. Arguing that our Government have nefarious interests and plan to once more bring Imperialism to the Americas, they have stated that this new policy would not go unanswered. While we did expect a response from the Americans in this matter, it is notable that this is nothing but a basic warning rather than threat of armed conflict over our policies. It is possible the Americans are trying to save face with this maneuver."
ukf.211.a: "And?"
ukf.212.t: "Washington threatens us with war!"
ukf.212.d: "Late yesterday evening our Ambassador in Washington was summoned by the Secretary of State of the United States to attend a closed-doors meeting regarding our recent foreign policy adjustments in regards to the Monroe Doctrine and the Americas as a whole. In no uncertain terms the Secretary of State made it clear that if our nation were to pursue these policies that it would jeopardise the peace between us, and potentially lead to armed conflict between our two nations.\n\nOur Ambassador to the United States has reported that he believes these threats to be genuine and that by rebuking the Monroe Doctrine that we have crossed a clear line for the American Government. Many within our Government are however in clear disagreement, believing that the Americans are once more making much fuss of nothing and that they would not risk a war that they would surely lose over a silly bit of paper."
ukf.212.a: "Ignore them"
ukf.212.b: "We do not take these insults lightly!"
ukf.213.t: "Westminster ignores our threats!"
ukf.213.d: "Despite our warning having been delivered to Westminster by our Ambassador in London we have yet to receive any response from the British Government over the matter. It would seem that the British Government has decided to ignore our interests in the Americas and openly flaunt our power in the region. Our responses are limited, and if we hope to continue dissuading European powers from meddling in the Americas we have little choice but to back our warnings with action."
ukf.213.a: "Then we shall respond with war!"
ukf.213.b: "We cannot risk a war right now"
ukf.214.t: "Westminster threatens us!"
ukf.214.d: "It would seem that sanity has left the halls of Westminster, as today our representative in London was summoned by the Foreign Minister of the British Government into a private meeting. Stating unequivocally that the British Empire would not be threatened by 'nothing more than a former colonial' she would take any threats of force as an insult to the dignity of the British nation and its people, and would therefore reciprocate accordingly.\n\nThese veiled threats by the British Government clearly indicate that they do not take our warnings seriously. If we are to save face in this crisis it may be necessary to follow through on these warnings, although the willingness of the British to threaten our nation with war indicates a level of preparedness on their part to engage in a direct conflict with our nation."
ukf.214.a: "We won't let those bastards push us around!"
ukf.214.b: "Perhaps we should avoid war, for now"

#Removing the Final Roadblock
ukf.350.t: "Removing the Final Roadblock"
ukf.350.d: "With the Cape to Calcutta railway now well under construction and the direct link between our African and Indian colonies secure, only one final roadblock remains in our way; the Kingdom of Siam.\n\nFriendly to our nation in the Great War, recently Siam has been mired by protests from revolutionary elements opposed to the King's rule in their nation. Such instability has weakened the King's grip significantly, and those within our Government believe the time has come to demand the Kra-Isthmus from Siam, thereby ensuring a direct link between Burma and Malaya, as well as allowing us to further extend the Cape to Calcutta rail line as far as Singapore."
ukf.350.a: "Demand that Siam becomes a protectorate"

ukf.351.d: "This morning the British representative in our capital delivered a letter to our Government demanding that we become a protectorate of the British Empire 'in the interests of regional security'. Such a demand is clearly outrageous, though one can only wonder what the British will do if we refuse."

ukf.354.d: "Late yesterday evening the British representative in Bangkok delivered a letter to our Government demanding the immediate transfer of the Kra-Isthmus to British control. Stating that the region had in recent years become a territory where rebels had been coordinating attacks against British Administration in Malaya, they have argued that our Government has done nothing to prevent these attacks. Such lies are preposterous nonsense, but the British would not issue this demand if they were not serious."

# London Naval Conference
ukf.2000.t: "London Naval Conference"
ukf.2000.d: "Initially signed in 1928 between the British Empire, Portugal and the Hellenic Republic, the London Naval Treaty was intended to limit further naval races between nations similar to the disastrous competition between the Royal Navy and Kaisermarine that took place prior to the Great War. While criticised by many foreign powers as simply acting as a vehicle for our nation to impose maritime superiority over others, the LNT has been useful in safe-guarding crucial trade routes around the globe.\n\nToday is an auspicious occasion, our Government has been preparing a Naval Conference to be held in London over the past several months in which our partners from Portugal and Greece will attend. This Conference is intended to not only be a chance to reinvigorate the LNT, but also to lay the ground-work for future expansion. Importantly, we will begin cooperating closely with the navies of these new signatories, granting some significant advantages to our navy and nation. This will surely only increase the more nations we can 'convince' to sign the pact. In the interest of peace, of course."
ukf.2000.a: "Let us formalise this treaty with our close friends"
ukf.2001.t: "London Naval Conference"
ukf.2001.d: "While the London Naval Treaty was signed between our nation and the British Empire in 1928, it was recently made invalid, as the official agreement was only intended to last eight years. As such the British Goverment has orchestrated a new London Naval Conference and invited our nation to attend.\n\nWhile some in our Government are critical of the LNT and its effects on our ship-building capabilities, the treaty comes with certain assurances from the British Empire that we may find useful in these unstable times."
ukf.2001.a: "Sign the agreement!"
ukf.2001.b: "We won't sign this ridiculous bit of paper"
ukf.2003.t: "Greece walks out of the Conference"
ukf.2003.d: "The Greek representatives at the London Naval Conference have agreed to renew the Naval Treaty between our two nations indefinitely. It seems that their concern for their security in the face of threats on the European continent out-weighs the fear of their navy being severely limited."
ukf.2003.a: "They will regret this day"
ukf.2004.t: "Portugal walks out of the Conference"
ukf.2004.d: "The Portuguese representatives at the London Naval Conference have agreed to renew the Naval Treaty between our two nations indefinitely.

ukf.2004.a: ""They will regret this day
ukf.2010.t: "London Naval Treaty"
ukf.2010.d: "Now that the London Naval Treaty has one again been renewed between ourselves and other nations, the time has come to invite additional members to the treaty. Europe is perhaps the most unstable continent in the world at this moment, and several nations are fearful of war breaking out between them and their neighbours. As such as should approach these nations in an attempt to capitalise on their fear and force them to join the LNT. Of course, the better our relations with these nations are, the more likely they are to accept."

ukf.2010.b: "We have no interest in this ridiculous pact!"
ukf.2011.t: "London Naval Treaty"
ukf.2011.d: "With the London Naval Conference held only recently, the British Government has approached our nation with an offer to officially join the London Naval Treaty.

ukf.2100.d: "The London Naval Treaty has expanded to encompass a great number of nations across the world, and in turn our influence has grown with it. The time has come to extend this treaty to one of our great European rivals, the Germans. We recognise that the greatest threat to our hegemony is the expansion of the French influence across the globe, and so we must work with the Germans to put the French back in their place. However, this does not mean that we and the Germans are friends – merely allies by circumstance. We cannot allow the Germans to take this time to attempt to challenge us and our navy, we must impose a naval treaty on them and prevent them from expanding their navy and in turn we shall assist them against the French menace."
ukf.2101.a: "We must avoid another naval race with Germany"
ukf.2101.t: "The Jutland Pact"
ukf.2101.d: "This morning the British Government approached our nation with a proposal with smoothing over the poor relations between our nations as well as setting out clear boundaries between us over the future of our two countries.\n\nThe British have therefore proposed that we enter into a naval agreement with their nation, named the Jutland Pact. This agreement will severely hamper our efforts to produce a navy, but in return the British will refrain from meddling in our affairs elsewhere and will given security guarantees to our nation.\n\nMany without our Government have outright rejected such a proposal, but if we are to reclaim our last territories British backing would surely help."
ukf.2101.a: "This will ensure peace between our two nations"
ukf.2101.b: "Limit our naval development? I think not!"
ukf.2102.t: "Germany signs the pact"
ukf.2102.d: "This morning German and British diplomats concluded their meetings in Berlon over the proposed Jutland Pact between our two nations. The meeting was a smashing success, and Germany has agreed to fully implement the pact in return for security guarantees."
ukf.2102.a: "Excellent"
ukf.2103.t: "Germany rejects the pact"
ukf.2103.d: "This morning the German representative in London handed our Government a formal reply to our proposal for a naval agreement between our two nations, stating that they would under any circumstances limit their own development and make themselves dependent on a foreign power."

ukf.2201.d: "This morning the British representative in our capital approached our Government with a proposal from Westminster. Despite relations being frayed in recent years due to tensions between our two empires, the British have made an attempt to smooth over this poor state of affairs, though their proposal has left many within our Government speechless over its audacity.\n\nApparently viewing the naval build-up between our two nations as a chief concern, the British have proposed that we sign a naval accord with their nation, named the Dover Pact. Such an agreement would severely hamper our efforts to produce naval vessels in the future, but would result in security guarantees from the British. Given the volatile state of affairs both in Europe and overseas, some in our Government believe that the agreement may be prudent to sign, at least for now."

ukf.2250.a: "Without us their security is threatened"
ukf.2250.d: "This morning the Foreign Office was notified of a recent departure from the London Naval Treaty. While the cause for their departure is still unknown, many suspect it is due to the poor relations with their nation and unwillingness to be part of a diplomatic agreement with a nation they regard poorly."
ukf.2500.t: "London Naval Treaty Membership"
ukf.2500.a: "The London Naval Treaty ensures naval security"
ukf.2500.d: "As new members flock to the LNT the effects of their membership begins to be felt in the Royal Navy and throughout the Empire. close cooperation with our friends will only boost our capability to produce, maintain, and innovate in the naval arena. What's more, the more nations we can convince to sign the treaty, the stronger these effects will become."

ukf.4999.d: "With war having once more broken our across the European mainland between Germany and France our Government has grown increasingly worried about what the results of the war may mean for the European status quo. Growingly there are suggestions that in order to claim a stake in the post-war peace process that Britain herself must become involved in the Second Great War, although the question remains: Which side should we support in this new war?"

Those within our Government who still harbour some isolationist tendencies have argued that we should limit our support for France, and send them purely shipments of weapons to aid in their fight.

#####IMPERIAL COMMUNICATION EVENTS######

emp.1.d: "At this year’s Imperial Conference, many issues have been raised both by the dominions and by the mother country. One of these topics is the issue of the Imperial Economic Policy and it would appear that the policy of the Empire in the future has been chosen, and as expected we are receiving the benefits of said policy and will continue to so long as we remain loyal to the British."
emp.2.d: "The most pressing issue at this year’s Imperial Conference is Britain’s own policy regarding the Empire and the status of the Dominions and Colonies. As expected, the mother country has decided to pursue the Status Quo and preserve the Empire in its current state, despite the many protests and demands from many Dominion representatives – especially the Canadian representative – for increased autonomy in line with their sacrifices in the name of Empire."
emp.3.d: "In a shocking display of treachery, our once loyal dominion of Canada has rejected our continuation of the Status Quo within the Empire! They are demanding that we either give into their requests for self-determination or offer some other form of compensation to keep them as our dominion. We knew that continuing this policy wouldn’t please many of the dominions, but we never expected such blatant treason as this!"
emp.4.d: "In response to our refusal of the Status Quo, Britain has approached us with an interesting and unexpected offer. They offer us full control over the Newfoundland Dominion in exchange for us rescinding our previous statements regarding the Status Quo and remaining apart of the Empire as a whole. Accepting this offer would certainly please many in our country, but it would also be turning our backs on our fellow dominions who we have fought tirelessly for to provide them the autonomy they deserve!"
emp.5.d: "The British have responded to our refutation of the Status Quo policy, and have informed us that they will never back down to a ‘treacherous colony.’ It is clear that the British care only for their own interests then the interests of their Empire, we can only hope that our actions inspire in the other dominions with the hope and courage to stand up to the British and their oppression!"
emp.6.d: "Just as we had hoped, the Canadians could not refuse our deal exchanging Newfoundland for their loyalty. The territory is now officially Canadian and they have agreed to remain a part of the Empire and stay loyal to the crown. The Empire is whole again."
emp.7.d: "To our great dismay, the Canadians have rejected our gracious offer of unification between them and Newfoundland. It would seem then for now that we are at an impasse, with the Canadians sure to bring up the issue again if we refuse to grant additional autonomy to the Dominions and attempt to maintain the status quo."
emp.9.d: "Reports from the colonial administration in India have indicated that once more Indian rebels are marching on Delhi in an attempt to oust our administrators and remove our influence from the sub-continent entirely.\n\nApparently spurred on by our refusal to give India increased autonomy, these rebels are likely to receive significant foreign support from nations hostile to our presence in the region."
emp.10.d: "The most important issue being raised in this year’s Imperial Conference is the issue of the status of the Dominions and colonies within the Empire. Britain has shocked many around the world, by announcing their plans for further decentralisation and increasing the autonomy of her various dominions worldwide. The motherland is finally giving us our recognition for our sacrifices in the Great War."
emp.11.d: "As India is once more caught in the grasp of a country-wide rebellion against British forces, we have been given the opportunity to assist the Indians in their fight against British oppression. By sending them arms and supplies it will be unlikely for us to directly turn the tide, but at the very least it will bog the British down in India further."
emp.12.d: "Assistance in the form of arms and supplies have arrived this morning from a foreign backer in support of our cause."
emp.15.d: "The most important issue being raised in this year’s Imperial Conference is the issue of the status of the Dominions and the Empire. This time, the British have proposed a truly enormous change in policy. An Imperial Federation, consisting of an Imperial Parliament with elected representatives from every Dominion, and in which each Dominion has control over their internal affairs while the Federation and Imperial Parliament decide foreign policy and external affairs for the Empire as a single entity. This is the grandest plan the British have ever proposed for the Empire, and many Dominion parliaments have already expressed outrage at the project."
emp.16.d: "A representative has delivered us their response to our proposal for an Imperial Federation. This is a truly ambitious project of ours, and so it is imperative we seek approval from our dominions in order to continue. Should a Dominion decline our proposal, we will have opportunities in the coming years to negotiate with their Parliament in an attempt to coerce them into agreement."
emp.21.d: "The Imperial Federation is a truly vast project, and as such requires vast renovations to every nation involved. Additionally, the political changes to our nation are bound to be great and so we must construct a new Imperial Parliament in the nation to house our Imperial representatives."
emp.22.d: "The Imperial Federation that we intend to pursue will not be an easy undertaking, we must manoeuvre carefully in order to keep the Dominions on our side when building the groundwork for such a Federation. It is therefore imperative we decide on the workings of the overarching Imperial Parliament and how best to properly represent the Empire.\n\nDominion acceptance of the proposed Federation is likely to depend significantly on our choice in this matter, with the First-past-the-post system being seen as unfavourably benefitting the UK at the expense of the rest of the Federation."
emp.23.d: "The Imperial Economy is a juggernaut on the world stage, taking top spot as the Workshop of the World the handling of it is not only an issue for our own Empire but an issue for the world as a whole. We must decide therefore, how best to conclude the Imperial Economic Policies within the Federation. We can either dictate the policy directly from London, or allow our Dominions a say in the Imperial Economy."
emp.24.d: "It is well known that whoever controls the military does in fact control the nation. Consequently, the topic of deciding who the Imperial High Command shall consist of has been of hot debate since we first proposed the Federation. Many of our dominions are demanding we provide them seats for representation within the High Command, however, our own generals argue that doing such a thing would only divide the High Command between different doctrinal thoughts and result in disorganisation in the event of another global conflict."
emp.25.d: "Our plans for the Imperial Federation are coming along splendidly! The main bulk of the preparations are finished or are underway, all that remains is to integrate the Dominions into the Federation – though the work does not stop there!"
emp.26.d: "The workings of the Imperial Economy will be vast and complex, each corner of this vast Federation will require different levels of funding for different things. We have therefore been approached by a group of economists within our country with a proposal to establish a central Imperial Bank. This would allow the Imperial Economy to run smoothly with each Dominion requesting the necessary funds for certain projects from this bank with any proposals needing approval from the Imperial Parliament. This would allow us to keep on top of any enormous expenses by our Dominions, and secure the economy in order to prevent another London Stock Market Crash style event."
emp.27.d: "The political situation inside the Federation is likely to be a complex web or parties, ideologies and policies. As of this day many Dominions in our Empire share vastly different political landscapes, and if this continues into the Federation it is sure to cause great conflict within the Imperial Parliament. To that end, an idea to establish a Unified Party System has been created in which we will establish branches of the main British political parties within each Dominion to create the kind of coherence and stability that this Federation will need."
emp.28.d: "Our Empire covers a huge amount of the Earth’s surface and contains a vast amount of resources within it, however, this does not mean that the resources within the Empire are the cheapest or offer the most attractive deals to other members in the Empire and as such we are losing vast amounts of income to foreign nations as a result. Consequently, we must establish a policy of Imperial Preference when it comes to trade in which the prices of goods from other dominions is much more attractive to other dominions then foreign goods thanks to a series of heavy tariffs."
emp.29.d: "By deciding to allow Dominion representatives onto our Military High Command, it is paramount that we ensure cohesion and proper organisation of the military – particularly if we face another global conflict akin to the Great War. We must therefore setup a system of Imperial Military Conferences to be called during wartime to formalise battle plans and military tactics if the situation arises."
emp.30.d: "The preparations are complete, the groundwork is finished and we are ready to begin the transition into The Imperial Federation. What was once a ridiculous dream of the most ambitious imperialist, will soon be reality. This is truly a momentous occasion for Britain and her Empire – but the work is not over yet. All that remains is notifying the Dominions that now is the time for their final decision on the matter."
emp.40.d: "Canada is a massive landmass with bountiful natural resources, with the resources of the British Empire firmly behind it we could turn Canada into a real industrial powerhouse, the only question is how?\n\nIf we spend resources to open new factories we could ensure that Canadian production becomes the envy of the world, and with all that empty land there is plenty of space to open new factories particularly in regions where there is higher unemployment.\n\nHowever, there is also massive deposits of oil in the western parries so much that it could rival the oil reserves of the middle east if tended to properly, perhaps it would be best to send some British trained explorers and miners out West to aid in harnessing this resource.\n\nThen again, Eastern Canada is the hub of the country and is unfortunately heavily separated from the west by vast plains that makes movement west nearly impossible for both administration and military, perhaps by investing in the TransCanada railway we could bring the East and West coasts closer together."
emp.41.d: "While South Africa has never been the most peaceful or stable of imperial dominions it does have a strategic value as well as a great notary one. In 1838 Diamonds were found near the Orange River and with that discovery South Africa became a much more important region. But how should we go about ensuring we get hold of these precious stones?\n\nSome say the most effective way to obtain these diamonds would not be dig for them ourselves but instead to ensure that there are proper facilities in place to process them once they are found. These new factories would also be a show of good faith to the people that the King does care about their well being.\n\nAnother option is the obvious one, we just start digging. We know roughly where the diamonds were found and if we expand British mining corporations in the region we are certain to find something beneath the earth. Even if its not the gems we want there are plenty of heavy metals that could be turned to much more practical purposes.\n\nThe final and least direct option is to focus on the infrastructure of the region. While certainly not as directly lucrative as building factories or digging for gems it will connect the Governor General to the entirety of his population and perhaps even pull some of the natives and Boers towards the coast, allowing them to properly join society."
emp.42.d: "While the Oceanic Dominions were for a time poorer than the other parts of the Empire they have in recent decades become extremely wealthy in no small part due to continued investment and immigration from the Home Isles. However, there is still more yet that can be done and experts have determined three manners in which we could do this.\n\nSeveral members of government have argued that the only effective way to increase the quality of life in Oceania would be to invest in and expand their agricultural sector. Many Australians and New Zealanders have taken to ranching and shepherding to make a living, if we pour money into these sectors they could increase production thus employing more of the population.\n\nOthers argue that there must be some natural resources to be found beneath the Oceanic earth. While it may take some time to find it if we do it will open up an entirely new form of business for the Australasians and who knows maybe they will find something really useful down there.\n\nThe last option would be to create job projects by finishing the Canberra to Perth Railway and the Island Rail networks. If we ensure we hire only local labour and oversight the people of Australia and New Zealand will be incredibly happy with our assistance and even more so will be able to transport both people and resources across the outback and through the mountains."
emp.43.d: "The Raj is and always has been a fantastic commercial tool for the British Empire, sending out silks, cotton, dyes, gems, tea and spices to the far reaches of the Empire to then be sold abroad. However, while building up the luxury resources we have left practicality fall to the wayside, parliament has give us funds to correct this, but what should we turn to?\n\nWe could attempt to create more factories in loyal regions of India this would help with unemployment and could cause a spike in more practical industries which they could then use to fund their own expansion going forward.\n\nAnother option would be to invest heavily into the resources of the region. With such a huge land base there is no way we will not find heavy metals or other more practical resources below the surface. All we would need to do is send in a few prospecting teams.\n\nOr we could try to complete the Indian Railway, this would ensure easier travel across the region which would give people the mobility they need in order to go and find jobs and be productive imperial citizens."
emp.50.d: "After years of political turmoil and inter-Imperial diplomacy, Westminster has today demanded our official, and final, response to the question of the Imperial Federation."

emp.100.d: "Several days have passed since the Dominion parliaments were officially dissolved and their representatives took their place at the Imperial Parliament in London. Only several years ago our Empire was divided, fractured and on the cusp of disintegration. The actions of a few brave men who sought to bring power and stability back to the Empire have ensured that we are once again a power to be reckoned with.\n\nWith instability at an end, and the people's of the Empire once more united towards a common goal, we stand together to face whatever challenges history will throw our way. Though the path ahead will be challenging and full of risk, we can take solace in the fact that we will face it not as a divided Empire, but as one nation with but one goal. Our flag will be raised across the globe, we will defend liberty wherever we can and we will ensure peace on this green Earth. We will not forget the age-old wisdom: 'United we stand, divided we fall'"
emp.500.d: "Since our announcement to pursue an Imperial Federation the Empire has seemed more volatile than ever before. While some of the Dominion Governments may have expressed interest in this Imperial Federation, several ethnic groups within the Empire have become outraged at the possibility. Most angry of all are the Boers.\n\nSince the end of the Third Boer War during the Great War, South Africa has lived in relative peace and harmony and while the fighting was brutal, many believed a certain degree of reconciliation was taking place in the country. To suggest so today however, one would only be met with derision.\n\nThe Boers - for the fourth time in less than sixty years - have risen the standard of rebellion against the Empire. Unwilling to allow their autonomy be taken from them in the Empire's attempts at federalisation, the Boers have already succeeded in raiding many arms depots throughout South Africa and have captured a large swathe of territory in their wake. More worringly, some military units of South Africa have defected to the Boer side. It seems that this Boer War may be bloodier than any before it."
emp.501.d: "While we are tied down in South Africa dealing with the Boers once more, it seems several prominent Indian nationalist politicians have seized the opportunity to declare total independence from the Empire. Stating that they could not remain inside an Empire that refuses to grant them greater autonomy, they were forced to take action to defend their nation. While the revolt of '35 was relatively spontaneous, today's revolt seems to be a coordinated affair with politicians and militia leaders acting together, as such only Burma and Ceylon remain under our control with the rest of our loyal forces either ousted from mainland India, or placed under temporary arrest by the new Indian administration.\n\nDespite this set-back plans are already in motion for returning to India to re-assert our rule. Several of the Indian Princes remain and some have indicated that they would support a return of British rule to the sub-continent in an effort to stabilise the region. Furthermore, while the Indian mainland is today united under a single banner, Royal Intelligence believes that this will not last long, with several smaller factions already ready to attempt a breakaway from the new Indian nation."
emp.502.d: "With our victory in ejecting the British out of South Africa and securing control over large swathes of the former Union of South Africa, we today have the opportunity to attempt to demand peace with the British."
emp.503.d: "With our military having been ejected from several territories formerly belonging to the Union of South Africa, the rebellious Boers have seen fit to sue for peace with our nation. They demand that we hand over control of South African territories to their control and withdraw all Imperial troops from the region. How should we respond?"
emp.504.d: "The British Government has foolishly rejected our demands for peace."
emp.511.d: "With the British Empire once more occupied with another Boer War, many within our Government believe that by sending arms and supplies to the Boers that we may boost their chances of finally driving the British from South Africa."

ukflavour.1.t: "The Manchester Canal Breach"
ukflavour.1.d: "When the Bolton-Manchester Canal burst its banks at Little Lever yesterday millions of gallons of water cascaded 300 feet into the River Irwell, carrying down hundreds of tons of earth and stones. The river rapidly became blocked on the Bury side and the banked-up water flooded the surrounding land. "Like Niagara" was the description applied by one resident in the vicinity. Bricks and iron reinforcements of the side of the canal were torn away and carried into the river. Canal barges were smashed up as they too swept over the falls. Fortunately, there are no houses in the neighbourhood, and no one was hurt. It is feared that work at a paper mill and a chemical works which depend upon the canal for transport will be affected."

ukflavour.3.d: "The Hobbit, or There and Back Again is a children's fantasy novel written by author J. R. R. Tolkien. It was published today to wide critical acclaim. It has been selling very fast and is already wildly popular due to its fantasy nature and exciting story. It is sure to be a big hit for a long time to come!"

ukflavour.4.t: "Alan Turing submits 'On Computable Numbers'"
ukflavour.4.d: "This morning Mr. Alan Turing published his new book 'On Computable Numbers, With an Application to the Entscheidungsproblem.'. The book which is quickly becoming popular among those interested in the development of computing machines, details the several of 'Turing's Proofs', an attempt at elaborating on the Entscheidungsproblem, the conclusion of which that it has no solution. While critics have already begun to pour over the book, many believe it is an important step forward in our understanding of Computing Machines."
ukflavour.4.a: "Computing Machines? What sort of madness is this?"
ukflavour.5.t: "Crystal Palace Fire"
ukflavour.5.d: "The original Crystal Palace was the centrepiece of the Great Exhibition of 1851 in London. Built in what is now Kensington Gardens, it was an astonishing prefabricated construction, created on parkland and still with many trees inside. Masterfully designed in glass, iron and wood by the architect Joseph Paxton, it wowed thousands of visitors to the exhibition from this country and all over the world and there could hardly have been a more effective demonstration of advanced British technology.\n\nLast night as a local walked his dog past the building he saw flames inside, after hurrying inside he discovered two nightwatchmen attempting to extinguish the fire. Despite their brave attempts, the Fire Brigade was called, arriving shortly after. Even then they could not successfully combat the fire, with it turning into an inferno. Several hours later hundreds of people had flocked to watch the spectacle as the blaze continued well into the morning. By the time the sun rose, it was clear that Paxton's masterpiece had been reduced to twisted metal and piles of scrap.\n\nOne of the most iconic buildings in Britain, a building opened by Queen Victoria herself, has been lost to tragedy."
ukflavour.5.a: "Horrible!"
ukflavour.6.t: "Baird Colour Television"
ukflavour.6.d: "Remarkable results in colour television were demonstrated by the Baird Company at the Dominion Theatre, Tottenham Court Road, early this month. The demonstration was remarkable in sevearl ways, and it was the first of its kind ever given, through in 1928 Mr. Baird showed a picture of a few inches square in colour at the British Association meeting in Glasgow. This, however, was transmitted by wire.\n\nIn this latest development the size of the picture is 12ft. by 9ft. and the transmission by radio from the South Tower of the Crystal Palace, a wavelength of 9.3 metres being used. Another special feature of the demonstration was that the colour is exceedingly good and on the whole more pleasing to the eye than are the latest colour films. No claim was made that the definition came up to the standard of the ordinary transmissions and Mr. Baird clearly stated that this was regarded as a preliminary experiment. Even so, the demonstration was most impressive and the results comes as a surprise to those who witnessed it."

ukflavour.7.d: "This morning the BBC Television Service officially launched from Alexandra Palace. It will become the world's first regularly scheduled public television service, allowing us to extend British media influence to nations around the globe.\n\nTwo systems, the 405-line Marconi-EMI and the 240-line Baird intermediate film system, were trialed for a period of six months prior to today in order to determine which was best suited for continued television service, with Marconi's 405-line ultimately being chosen."

ukflavour.8.d: "For the past two years the John Brown and Company shipyard in Clydebank, Scotland, has been hard at work designing an improved version of RMS Queen Mary, an ocean liner which only recently performed its maiden voyage in May of 1936.\n\nThe RMS Queen Elizabeth was designed to be a much improved version of her sister ship, with additional deck and cargo space, as well as increased passenger service. At midday today the Queen herself performed the launching ceremony and the ship has been sent for fitting out. It will still be some time before she conducts her maiden voyage as numerous engine tests are required, but the RMS Queen Elizabeth is once again more proof, if any more were needed, of the skills of British craftsmanship in the area of naval construction."

ukflavour.9.d: "Legendary British racing motorist, Mr. John Cobb, has once again set a new land speed record in Bonneville today. Driving the piston-engined, wheel-driven Railton Special he broke the Land Speed Record at a speed of 367.91mph, having beaten the previous record set by Mr. George Eyston at 357.5mph, also at Bonneville."

ukflavour.10.t: "Sinking of HMS Thetis"
ukflavour.10.d: "Tragedy has struck today twelve miles off the coast of Great Orme, Llandudno, Wales. HMS Thetis which was performing sea trials sank unexpectingly, in what many believe to have been an accident. Preliminary investigations have indicated that the bow of the submarine was flooded by seawater, although there are no indications as of yet as to how the submarine flooded. It took several hours before the telegram raising the alarm arrived at the Royal Navy's submarine HQ in Portsmouth, and even longer before a ship could reach the area to begin rescue operations, as the nearest vessel was several hundred miles away.\n\nOnly four men have reportedly escaped the disaster, with the remainder of the vessel's crew having perished due to oxygen deprivation or in attempts to flee the vessel via the hatch previously used to escape by others. Royal Navy Submarine Headquarters has said that it will be many months before the ship can be reached, and the bodies of those dead removed for burial."
ukflavour.10.a: "A horrible disaster for all of Britain"
ukflavour.11.t: "Launching of HMS Trafalgar"
ukflavour.11.d: "For the past several years, the best dockyard workers from across the Empire have converged in Scapa Flow to construct HMS Trafalgar, the largest battleship ever constructed in history. While normally secretive, much fuss has been made of the construction of this vessel as HMS Trafalgar is intended to serve as a symbol of British naval dominance.\n\nNamed after our victory over the combined French and Spanish fleets at Trafalgar in 1805, the date has since been used as a historical note to mark the beginning of our unmatched naval dominance.\n\nHMS Trafalgar will serve not only as a symbol of our strength, but as a reminder that our thalassocracy cannot be challenged successfully."

ukflavour.12.t: "American Author Visits Britain"
ukflavour.12.d: "As the genre of science-fiction continues to stir the imagination of the populace of both the British Empire and those around the world, a burgeoning author from the United States today concluded a small conference in Aberdeen, Scotland where he spoke at length of the prospects of science fiction in the future.\n\nRobert A. Heinlein was a former United States Navy Officer who was discharged over a decade ago after being diagnosed with pulmonary tuberculosis, he has since gone on to write several short stories in the new science fiction genre. Fascinated by the form of Government within the our nation following Jack's political reforms - even speaking with several military officers within the British Armed Forces about them - he has since returned to his home in the United States following his stay in our country. Speaking of his experience in the United Kingdom, he simply stated that he found the stay interesting and informative. One wonders if it will have any affect on his work in the coming future."

ukflavour.30.t: "Battle for Hill 415"
ukflavour.30.d: "This morning as elements of the British Army converged on a German fortification - known among local military commanders simply as 'Hill 415' - perhaps the most bizarre battle of the war so far was to begin. As British soldiers approached the fortification through thick fog, a roar sounded from the German lines followed by the sounds of rushing footsteps. Quickly it became apparent that the German position had abandoned defence and opted to charge the British soldiers, using the fog for cover. What came next was unexpected for both sides.\n\nIt began with a crash and a scream as a charging German infantryman - axe in hand - planted the weapon squarely between the eyes of a startled British soldier. Recognising what was happening the British Army Officer in charge gave the order to switch to military sabres and engage the enemy in hand-to-hand. Over the course of the next hour British and German infantrymen engaged in one of the largest close combat battles since the Napoleonic era.\n\nAs the fog cleared the true horror soon became visible to all. Several hundred dead British and German soldiers, some brutally mutilated, others with the weapons that killed them still buried in their bodies lay thick across the area. The Battle of Hill 415 was over."

ukflavour.40.t: "Paris Captured"
ukflavour.40.d: "Glorious news has reached the Government this morning of successful military options to capture Paris from French control. For the first time since the Hundred Years' War British troops have successfully laid siege to Paris and captured it for the glory of the British Empire.\n\nWhile fighting continues in the outskirts of the city a military parade was quickly organised by the British Commander with British troops marching underneath the Arc de Triomphe as horrified Parisians looked on. While the war with France is expected to continue the blow that has been struck to our rival today cannot be understated.\n\nAt last, our victory is within reach."
ukflavour.40.a: "How the once mighty have fallen."
ukflavour.41.t: "Berlin Captured"
ukflavour.41.d: "While denied to us in the Great War, today marks a momentous day in our war against the German. The Army has successfully captured Berlin with support from the Royal Air Force.\n\nBitter fighting erupted almost immediately as our soldiers entered the city though it was not enough to delay our advance and capture of important landmarks around the city. The German Fuhrer is said to have fled the city days ago, and his whereabouts are currently unknown. Search parties have spread out from the city in an attempt to discover where he may have fled to. As the war with Germany continues it has become clear to all at home and abroad that we have the iniative in this war. The only question remains; how much longer will victory elude our grasp?"
ukflavour.41.a: "Germany will soon meet its end."
ukflavour.42.t: "Rome Captured"
ukflavour.42.d: "Rome, once the capital of perhaps the greatest Empire the world has ever seen, has fallen into our control. Brave soldiers of the British Army succeeded in storming the city in recent days, although guerilla fighting continues on the streets of the city as stubborn Italian defenders attempt to harass our soldiers.\n\nAs war with Italy continues unabated many wonder how longer the Italians will continue to fight with their capital under foreign occupation and with public support for their Government's war effort beginning to dwindle. All that is known however is that our onslaught across the Italian peninsula is likely to continue, and with the capture of Rome morale across the British Armed Forces has increased significantly."
ukflavour.42.a: "The Eternal City is now under our control"
ukflavour.43.t: "Constantinople Captured"
ukflavour.43.d: "Constantinople, the City of the World's Desire, has been successfully captured and occupied by British soldiers. Long held by the Ottoman Empire after their conquest of the remnants of the Eastern Roman Empire, the Conquest of Constantinople was in many ways a wake-up call for European nations and the threat that was posed by the powerful Ottoman Empire.\n\nWhile successfully occupied by Allied Forces in the Great War, the occupation was to be short-lived. Today the occupation of Constantinople will continue indefinitely, at least until the Turkish nation has been crushed by our Armed Forces."
ukflavour.43.a: "None shall question our greatness."
ukflavour.44.t: "Washington Captured"
ukflavour.44.d: "Reports from the North American frontlines indicate that British troops have successfully captured Washington DC from American defenders. Stubbornly defended by tens of thousands of American soldiers, the siege of Washington required every weapon in the Armed Forces to win. Beginning with a lengthy air bombardment of entrenched positions throughout the city, and accompanied by a similar bombardment from the Royal Navy, British troops moved slowly through the streets of DC before finally driving the American defenders out.\n\nCelebrations were limited as American partisans almost immediately began attacking British convoys in the region, with soldiers dying at the hands of armed civilians and soldiers in hiding. In retaliation - and in repetition of the war of 1812 - British soldiers plundered and set fire to the White House in an act of vengeance. The blaze would continue well into the night, with American citizens looking on in solemn silence.\n\nThe war with the Americans is far from over, but our victory in Washington has sent a clear message to the United State's Government; we are not to be trifled with, and our campaign will continue until we secure total victory."
ukflavour.44.a: "I bet the Yanks aren't happy about this."
ukflavour.45.t: "Boston Captured"
ukflavour.45.d: "Over 150 years ago, the fateful events of the now well-known Boston Tea Party were to shake our grip in the Americas to its very core. Launched by political protestors, it is considered today to be a significant event in the American Revolution and in spurring on other rebels across the Thirteen Colonies to resist our rule in the region.\n\nThe significance of the capture of Boston is both strategic, but also symbolic. In many ways Boston was the beginning of the end of our rule over the Thirteen Colonies, with its recapture today it may mark the beginning of a renewed British rule over North America."
ukflavour.45.a: "Where the American Dream began and where we shall put it to an end."
ukflavour.46.t: "Moscow Captured"
ukflavour.46.d: "The heart of Russia, and its capital city, has been captured by advancing British soldiers. Previously occupied by Napoleon's Grande Armée after retreating Russian troops set it ablaze, it has since come to harbour the Collectivists following the Russian Revolution.\n\nThe road to Moscow has been frought with struggle and suffering, many tens of thousands lie dead, with many more sure to suffer before this war ends. For now, some believe that the capture of Moscow marks the end for Russia, and the victory of Britain over them, others whisper that they fear the war will continue unabated, with the Russians largely unfazed by the occupation of one of their most important cities."
ukflavour.46.a: "We have ripped out the heart of the bear."
ukflavour.50.t: "Empire Day"
ukflavour.50.d: "Celebrated yearly since the death of Her Majesty Queen Victoria, Empire Day has once again come to pass. Widely acknowledged throughout the Empire, this day represents the bonds that bind the Empire and those that make us family. Our shared history and our common culture, our respect for rule of law and liberty above all!\n\nAs people across the British Empire host parties and marches we are reminded of our shared destiny, that Britain and her faithful sons and daughters will never falter, and that so long as we stand together we can overcome any difficulty."

uk.3000.d: "The nation of Italy, our ally in the Great War, has offered to purchase Malta from us. Malta has been a British territory since 1814 and has served us well as an important naval base in the mediterranean. At any other time a request to buy Malta would have been instantly disregarded but in the wake of the London Market Collapse it may benefit our great nation to accept the Italian offer and invest the income somewhere else."

ukadm.1.t: "First Lord of the Admiralty"
ukadm.1.a: "Let's give Churchill another chance"
ukadm.1.b: "Leo Amery has proven himself before"
ukadm.1.c: "Cooper is the man for the job"
ukadm.1.d: "For five years the Right Honourable Bolton Eyres-Monsell has served as the first Lord of the Admiralty in our Government, though he has for the past few months signalled to the Government that he wishes to resign his post citing ill health, only participating in the backbenches of Parliament where necessary.\n\nIt therefore falls to us to determine who shall replace the Viscount as First Lord of the Admiralty, and there are several choices we can make.\n\nThe first proposal is to bring Sir Winston Churchill once more back into Government. Despite his failure at the Dardanelles during the Great War - the failure of which led to the cancellation of his brainchild, the proposed Gallipoli Campaign - Churchill has managed to stay afloat politically, but only barely, using his influence with several high-ranking members of the Royal Navy to maintain his relevance.\n\nSecondly we have Leo Amery, previous First Lord of the Admiralty in the 1920's, and seen as a reliable candidate to replace the Viscount, Amery has however seen scrutiny by some MPs for his close links to the Round Table Movement and it's interest in Imperial politics. Regardless, Amery has shown himself to be capable in the post and would be a reliable choice.\n\nOur final candidate is Alfred Duff Cooper. Somewhat of a firebrand in Parliament, and highly critical of the Government's recent position of pacifism in the face of rising tension worldwide, Cooper would ensure the Royal Navy maintains its strength abroad and at home."
ukadm.2.t: "Opposition to Naval Cuts"
ukadm.2.a: "We must all tighten our belts."
ukadm.2.d: "While British society has been relatively docile since the events of the Manchester Mill Worker's Strike, there have been grumblings in several quarters of Britain. Today we have received reports of wide-spread dissent lurking in Royal Navy ranks regarding planned cuts to their pay and overall funding. Notably such dissent is also said to be coming from some Admirals who argue that the Royal Navy will no longer be able to adequately defend our Empire if these cuts continue.\n\nThough these concerns have worried some Members of Parliament - the issue itself having been raised in the Commons only recently - it appears that for now any complaints are largely only voiced behind closed doors. Until such a time as they are voiced elsewhere this matter remains of little concern."
ukadm.3.t: "Sailor's Strike"
ukadm.3.a: "The Red Flag? Put down these revolutionaries at once!"
ukadm.3.b: "Perhaps we should negotiate before this gets out of hand."
ukadm.3.d: "Taking many within our Government by surprise, a detachment of sailors stationed at Invergordon have today begun a strike against the Government over cuts made to their pay, as well as the larger austerity policies pursued by our Government in response to the effects of the LSMC.\n\nMost worrying of all is the nature of the strike itself, with many red banners being flown in and around the area, and socialist songs such as 'the Red Flag' being sung by those involved. While such an action is very unacceptable, the Government response has been relatively tame so far, as we do not wish to stir up any further dissent by approaching the issue heavy-handidly. With that in mind the Government has called for a meeting on the issue of naval cuts to fully flesh out our policy in regards to thse strikers and the larger issue of broad naval funding cuts."
ukadm.4.t: "First Sea Lord Voices Concern"
ukadm.4.a: "We do not tolerate mutiny in the Royal Navy!"
ukadm.4.b: "These cuts may have gone too far"
ukadm.4.d: "Now that our Government has decided to pursue an aggressive policy against the Royal Navy strikers plans are being made to break up the strikes and force these individuals to back down. Concerns have however been raised by the First Sea Lord of the Admiralty as well as several Royal Navy Admirals over the manner in which the Government intends to break up the strikes, with many warning that it will only seriously inflame the entire situation.\n\nPrivately some Admirals of the Royal Navy have also demanded that we allow them to settle the issue themselves rather than move forward with our current plans, to make amtters worse there is some internal grumblings within our own party over the issue. This coordinated push-back against our Government will make it difficult to continue with our previous efforts to crush the strike."
ukadm.5.t: "Mutiny at Invergordon"
ukadm.5.a: "Summon Royal Navy Admirals to London to discuss these developments"
ukadm.5.d: "With our Government having deciced to move forward decisively to crush the strike by sailors of the Royal Navy, some believed it was only a matter of time before the entire situation unravelled. Therefore when the events of this morning occurred, it took few by surprise.\n\nAngered by Government attempts to disregard the issues raised over naval funding cuts, the strikers were apparently successful in convincing many more of their comrades to join their efforts, with several vessels stationed at Invergordon this morning completely devoid of any crew, as the bulk of them had joined the strikers in protesting Government policy.\n\nThe Royal Navy Captains and Admirals who had been warning of such a possibility have been proven right by time, and continue to voice concerns over our Government's approach, some of them taking to local and national newspapers to do so. There is an aura of mutiny spreading throughout the entirety of the Royal Navy, and unless it is handled soon the situation may further spiral out of control."
ukadm.6.t: "Cooper meets with Admirals"
ukadm.6.a: "Perhaps some sort of agreement can be made"
ukadm.6.d: "First Lord of the Admiralty, Alfred Duff Cooper, has met with the First Sea Lord, and the various Admirals summoned to the capital this morning to discuss on-going events at Invergordon. Cooper was chosen as First Lord of the Admiralty due to his reliability and his significant ties and influence within the Royal Navy that he built up during the inter-war years while working under the previous First Lord of the Admiralty, Bolton Eyres-Monsell. Though there are some questions raised as to where his loyalty lies as he has shown favour to the Armed Forces in the past, siding against the Government over planned spending cuts to the British Army and Royal Air Force.\n\nHaving developed the aforementioned close links with the Royal Navy, especially among high-ranking individuals within it, Cooper was chosen to represent the Government in this particular issue due to the latent hostility between the Royal Navy Officer Corps and the Government over its continued polciies towards slashing naval funding.\n\nIt remains to be seen whether or not a deal can be made to end the unrest in the Royal Navy, though this is perhaps our best option."
ukadm.7.t: "Admirals demand repeal of cuts"
ukadm.7.a: "This isn't what we had in mind"
ukadm.7.b: "Fire that idiot Cooper at once!"
ukadm.7.d: "When the meeting between Cooper and the Royal Navy Admirals concluded many were breathing a sigh of relief, as it had appeared that a deal had been concluded between the two. What many did not expect was that the Admirals would - rather than relent on their position - double down on it, demanding openly in a signed letter to national newspapers a complete reversal of the Government's position on naval cuts. To add fuel to the fire, the First Sea Lord of the Admiralty has also for the first time sided publically with the Royal Navy rather than continue his previous approach of discussing these concerns with the Government discreetly.\n\nMany within our Government are in a fury over Cooper's obvious duplicity in this matter, but many more are beginning to change their positions on this concern, obviously sensing a change in the direction of where this situation is heading.\n\nSince this unrest began many of the public have been slowly coming around to the strikers position, and what is now regarded as the Royal Navy position, on the entire issue. Government popularity continues to plummet quite fantastically, and this show of opposition both without and within our Party, has only created a political crisis within our Government. We must act swiftly if we are to rectify this issue, if necessary ensuring that Cooper is removed from his position entirely."
ukadm.8.t: "Crisis of Leadership"
ukadm.8.a: "A new leadership contest is called"
ukadm.8.d: "With the inability of our Government to come up with a concrete plan to tackle the current crisis, Westminster has been paralyzed by inaction, and rebellious Members of Parliament have begun to push for fresh leadership elections to enact a 'change of policy' towards the Royal Navy.\n\nIn a surprising turn of events a relatively young and unknown MP has taken the lead in opposing the Government over this issue, one Anthony Eden. Young and inexperienced, though hostile to proposed plans to curb the extent of the British Armed Forces, Eden has managed to not only bring around many within our own party to his point of view but has also succeeded in drawing great attention among the public sphere to this scandal by interviews in national newspapers, having become something of a notable public figure in the process. It is curious how he managed to propel himself to such an extent so rapidly, many suspect that those Admirals who oppose the Government have thrown their lot in with Eden as a means of boosting his influence within our Party in an effort to push through their agenda. With this backing Eden has succeeded in forcing the Government to push through for a vote of no confidence in the Prime Minister.\n\nIt would seem we are left with little choice on what to do next."
ukadm.9.t: "The Prime Minister is Ousted"
ukadm.9.a: "Welcome aboard Prime Minister Eden!"
ukadm.9.d: "As the sun fell on the Houses of Parliament last night, many MPs were uncharacteristically still present until the small hours of the morning in an effort to settle the issue of leadership within our party once and for all.\n\nFailing to receive the votes necessary in a closer-door vote of no-confidence, Sir Samuel Hoare was forced to acquiesce to fresh leadership elections within our party.\n\nUnsurprisingly the influential Anthony Eden had deftly navigated the situation to position himself as a front-runner in this new contest, having used his support from the Admirals, First Sea Lord, and the Royal Navy to further bolster his position. Curiously many of his policies proposed seem to differ somewhere on his previously stated political position on many subjects, leading some to wonder what precisely was agreed with those Admirals who had opposed Government policy in his meeting with them just a few weeks ago.\n\nRegardless, as dawn begins to set over London a busy night has been concluded, and few people expected any other result than what was made clear last night."
ukadm.10.t: "Midnight Meeting"
ukadm.10.a: "Britain must be defended from threats within, as well as without."
ukadm.10.d: "Several weeks have passed since the now Prime Minister Eden took his place as leader of the Conservative Party and of the British nation itself, and it would seem that the agreement made with him has been quickly implemented, with him pursuing the policies that were agreed upon. To show our intention to honour our agreement fully, we met with the Prime Minister at Westminster at Midnight last night to further determine what our policies should be for the foreseeable future, in resolute agreement with our determination to strengthen the Royal Navy and Britain's place on the Seven Seas, the Prime Minister has laid out his own grand plans for the creation of several extremely powerful and commanding naval vessels in the near future. Due to the effects the Mutiny at Invergordon had on the Government, we have found ourselves with significant influence in both the Conservative Party and Civil Service. This will no doubt ensure that Eden remains in his position for the forseeable future, allowing him to continue pushing forward and supporting the policies that were agreed upon those weeks ago.\n\nTo conclude last night's meeting, a vow was declared between those in Government and those in the Royal Navy; that never again will politicians be allowed to threaten the safety and security of the British people once more. The Royal Navy must remain a sacred institution, untouched by the petty politics of the day. In order to ensure this we must continue to exert our influence where necessary."
ukadm.11.t: "Negotiations with Strikers"
ukadm.11.a: "Give in to their demands"
ukadm.11.b: "These 'requests' are ridiculous!"
ukadm.11.d: "With our Government's choice to attempt to negotiate with the Royal Navy strikers, a series of negotiations have been organised to help overcome this crisis.\n\nSo far the demands have been what we expected, a return to previous pay for the sailors of the Royal Navy for a period of no less than 12 months, with future negotiations to decide whether or not this pay should continue - as it will depend on further economic developments -, many within our Government believe that even these demands are going a step too far, as one must understand the Royal Navy's history of mutiny.\n\nIn a historical perspective, this is one of only a few occassions that the Royal Navy has ever begun a mutiny of sorts against the Government, many are fearful that by allowing ourselves to be intimidated by these strikers it will only invite further revolt across the Armed Forces and Royal Navy.\n\nRegardless of the historical context, it comes to us today to decide the fate of these negotiations."
ukadm.12.t: "Mutineers Stand Down"
ukadm.12.a: "Disaster averted."
ukadm.12.d: "With the efforts of our Government in ending the strike successful, those would-be mutineers have returned to duty and the public have lost interest in the entire affair as other more important issues have begun to permiate national news.\n\nThis affair has served as a reminder to all those within the Armed Forces that the Government does not back down over issues as severe as these."
ukadm.15.t: "Influence of the Royal Navy"
ukadm.15.a: "It's time we shake up the military establishment."
ukadm.15.b: "There's no need for this."
ukadm.15.d: "Now that our influence over the Government in Westminster is secure we have begun rectifying many of the past mistakes of successive Governments of the Empire. While this occurs, there have been some concerns raised over protecting our hold over the Government in the long term. Proposals have therefore been put forward to reshuffle sections of the Government and the Conservative Party when possible to install individuals who are more sympathetic to our cause, specifically those who formerly served in the Royal Navy, and will likely see eye-to-eye with many of our policies.\n\nSuch an action will undoubtedly cost a certain amount of political capital, but will strengthen our Government's position in the long run."
ukadm.16.t: "Branches of the Armed Forces"
ukadm.16.a: "The Royal Navy above all."
ukadm.16.b: "There is no need to upset things further"
ukadm.16.d: "With the Royal Navy's influence growing daily within the halls of Westminster, many within the partnership have begun to believe that the time has arrived to curb the influence of the British Army and RAF as well. This would undoubtedly strengthen the position of the Navy further, though it may have ramifications at a later date that are less than ideal."
ukadm.17.t: "Inefficient Training"
ukadm.17.a: "Unfortunate, but not unexpected."
ukadm.17.d: "While at the time it seemed absurd that by giving priority to the Royal Navy we would weaken our military as a whole, it would appear that our previous choice to support the RN above the other institutions of the Armed Forces has had a negative effect after-all."
ukadm.18.t: "Election of 1942"
ukadm.18.a: "The Tories win a majority"
ukadm.18.d: "After five long years since the previous election - where it would appear that the entire world has been flipped on its own head - our country has continued relatively unscathed in the commotion that was to occur globally. Our Government had naturally seen some havoc following the events of the Invergordon Mutiny, but with an iron will, many individuals whose loyalty lies only with Britain and the Empire saved the day and brought down those who would have destroyed the British Empire from within, and we do not forget our agreements with the new Government in Westminster.\n\nToday marks a new election period in British history, and using the expansive influence at our beck-and-call, there can be little doubt as to its outcome."
