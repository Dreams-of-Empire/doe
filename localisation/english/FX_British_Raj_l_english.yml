#####Events#####

raj.1.t: "The British Raj"
raj.1.d: "Since 1765, the Indian subcontinent has been under the thumb of the British Empire. In that year, the English East India Company secured land on the Indian subcontinent and began exercising heightened levels of control over the Indian economy, beginning a relationship seemingly doomed to fail from the start. Over the next century and a half, the East India Company gradually provided the British Empire with increased control over India’s political and governmental systems, until it was all but another British colony. In 1857, a widespread Indian Revolt was brutally suppressed, and direct control of India was transferred from the Company to the Crown. The following year, the Raj was introduced as the British colonial government over all of India and Burma. \n\nFor nearly two hundred years, Indian politics have been characterized by resistance to British rule. The Indian National Congress was founded as a political movement in 1885 and became the principal leader of the Indian Independence movement. While initially only a small group, the Congress became a mass movement following the Great War, and subsequently became a thorn in the Empire’s side. Satyagraha - a measure of civil disobedience practiced by many of the Congress's supporters, ground portions of the nation’s economy to a standstill. These movements were led by Mahatma Gandhi, the leader of the Congress after the War. In 1924, Gandhi was shot and killed when British soldiers opened fire on a peaceful protest. This event sparked riots across the country that were not put down for several months. In response to greater calls for self-governance from the Indian population, the British government introduced the Government of India Act, designed to transfer sovereignty to the Raj over an extended period of time. However, The Act was voted down in Parliament in 1935, enraging the leaders of the old Indian National Congress and making the position of the Indian government that much more precarious. \n\nToday, the British administration in India is forced to tread carefully as whispers of rebellion haunt their government and threaten British dominion over south Asia."
raj.1.a: "We will persevere. We must."

raj.2.t: "Banning Communist and Nationalist Propaganda"
raj.2.d: "The Communist and Nationalist wings of the Indian independence parties have long been the most outspoken. The Communists have long advocated for an independent 'People's State,' while the Nationalists have fought for an independent, autocratic India that would encompass most of southern Asia. While the Indian National Congress has long been a thorn in our side, these two groups in particular have caused issues, from protests that have paralyzed our economy to blatant attacks on our armed forces. \n\nFollowing the discovery of the revolt plot, a plan has been proposed to our government to ban Communist and Nationalist propaganda under punishment of imprisonment. Doing so would almost surely further inflame their would-be rebel followers, but allowing them to continue speaking could create massive problems further down the line, once this crisis has been resolved."
raj.2.a: "Let them speak. We need to focus on the immediate threat." #Fragment
raj.2.b: "Ban their speech. Limit the spread of their ideas." #Revolt

raj.3.t: "Where to Send Additional Security"
raj.3.d: "With the suspected revolt less than four months away, our administration has begun allocating additional funding for security purposes. The British have put in requests to the Governor General to reinforce British assets and positions, largely focused along the coast. Doing so would certainly help in preventing them from falling into enemy hands if the revolt begins. But others in our government, including the leaders of the semi-autonomous Princely States, have advocated for the reinforcements to be directed to their fortifications, which are located mainly in the interior of the country. Doing so could solidify our alliances with them and secure their loyalty, should the revolt come to fruition. But fortifying their positions could give them an upper hand should they ever choose to move against us in the future."
raj.3.a: "Prioritize securing British assets." #Revolt
raj.3.b: "Prioritize securing local fortifications." #Fragment

raj.4.t: "Clemency to Rebel Leaders"
raj.4.d: "Over the past two decades, our administration has arrested countless dissidents and leaders of independence or resistance movements. While those movements did not compare in size or scale to what we suspect we may face in three months, most of their leaders still languish in prisons across the country. \n\nA recent proposal within our adminsitration to grant some of the lesser offenders clemency has gained traction. Doing so, proponents argue, would help mitigate the rage fueling the suspected revolt. However, critics point out that releasing them could also allow them to resume their subversive activities as soon as the crisis is over."
raj.4.a: "Grant them Clemency." #Fragment
raj.4.b: "They are in prison for a reason." #Revolt

raj.5.t: "Power to Local Militias"
raj.5.d: "An extraordinarily controversial proposal has come before our government, now that we are only two months out from the suspected revolt. Some of our ministers are proposing that we grant power, supplies, and autonomy to local militias - largely those that would defend the Princely States. Doing so, they argue, would stop the revolt before it could even begin in many regions. They argue that non-British armed forces would appear less threatening, and be more capable of dissuading the public from violence. However, the very obvious drawback to this is that once we grant these militas this power, we will never be able to take it away without a fight. Giving them this autonomy now could tear our entire country to pieces in the future."
raj.5.a: "Grant them the power to supress the rebels." #Fragment
raj.5.b: "We will not have unregulated militias running around the country." #Revolt

raj.6.t: "Aid from Britain"
raj.6.d: "While the British admiralty has doubted our intelligence reports on the suspected revolt since the beginning, their government ministers appear to have finally accepted the danger that we face, and have offered us assistance in the form of supplies and soldiers. While accepting the supplies is a given, taking in British soldiers is more controversial. Many in our government are eager to accept British troops, and argue for stationing them at various suspected hotspots throughout the country. Others, however, are urging caution, warning that bringing in more British soldiers would only further the revolt's cause. Of course, additional soldiers could be the difference between victory and defeat in a few weeks. This is not a decision we can take lightly."
raj.6.a: "Ask for military assistance. We need it desperately." #Revolt
raj.6.b: "The people already hate us. Bringing in more British would only worsen that." #Fragment

raj.7.t: "The Day of Reckoning"
raj.7.d: "The day our intelligence agents told us of six months ago is now upon us. Everyone in the government is standing beside their radios, waiting with bated breath for news from the countryside. Have rebels risen up and seized arms depots? Have the cities turned against us? So far, there has only been silence. And in silence, we can only wait..."
raj.7.a: "It's quiet..."

raj.8.t: "Calm in the Streets"
raj.8.d: "The streets are calm. The people are at peace. \n\nWhile our intelligence reports indicated that a massive revolt would begin throughout the Raj today, it appears that it was entirely mistaken. That, or we were able to successfully mitigate it in its entirety. Some very small bands have taken up arms in remote villages throughout the rural countryside, but they are being put down even now without issue, and will not threaten us in the slightest. Yet while this is the cause for much celebration in New Delhi, some are expressing caution. In order to subvert the suspected violence, we were forced to grant a massive amount of concessions to would-be rebels and their leaders. While they may not rise up in armed revolt, they may cause a very serious amount of trouble for us very soon."
raj.8.a: "A revolt avoided. We have done well."

raj.9.t: "A Minor Uprising"
raj.9.d: "It appears that our intelligence reports were correct about the uprising, but quite far off in their estimate of its severity. The rebels that we face today are ill-equipped, under-fed, and few and far between. Still, they cannot be taken lightly. They have managed to secure a broad swath of territory from Calcutta to Afghanistan, and while they may be weak, they are in a position to siege the capital city of New Delhi. While pospects for our swift victory are high, we cannot underestimate our foe."
raj.9.a: "Let's end this once and for all."
raj.9.b: "Freedom for India!"

raj.10.t: "Uprising Across India"
raj.10.d: "It appears that our intelligence reports were correct about the uprising, but thankfully off in their estimate of its severity. The rebels that we face today are ill-equipped and few and far between. Still, they cannot be taken lightly. They have managed to secure a broad swath of territory from Calcutta to Afghanistan, and while they may be weak, they are in a position to siege the capital city of New Delhi. While pospects for our victory are good, we cannot underestimate our foe."
raj.10.a: "We will win. We must."
raj.10.b: "Freedom for India!"

raj.11.t: "Significant Uprising Across India"
raj.11.d: "It appears that our intelligence reports were correct about the uprising, both in its timing and severity. The rebels that we face today are ill-equipped but large in number. They must not be taken lightly. If given the chance, they could topple everything we have strived to build here. They have managed to secure an extensive swath of territory from Calcutta to Afghanistan, and they are in a position to siege the capital city of New Delhi. We cannot afford to underestimate our foe; this fight will be for the very future of the Raj."
raj.11.a: "For the Empire!"
raj.11.b: "Freedom for India!"

raj.12.t: "Major Uprising Across India"
raj.12.d: "The revolt is worse than we could have expected. The rebels are well-equipped and vast in number, at times resembling a foreign army more than a ragtag group of farmers and street urchins. They are in a fair position to topple everything we have strived to build here if given the chance. They've secured a massive amount of territory from Calcutta to Afghanistan, and are in the process of sieging the capital city of New Delhi. We will need all the help we can get from the rest of the Empire; this fight is one for the very future of the Raj...and it's one we don't know if we can win."
raj.12.a: "May God help us all."
raj.12.b: "Freedom for India!"

raj.13.t: "Massive Uprising Across the Raj"
raj.13.d: "The revolt is far worse than anything we could have expected. It seems as if the entire population of the Raj has risen up against us. Rebels from Calcutta to Tranvacore have risen up and seized military bases, city centers, and ports. From the empty countryside to the crowded urban centers, their message is the same. They intend to defeat our forces totally and without question, and to force us and our British counterparts into the sea. We are now fighting for the very existence of the Raj, and it may not be a fight that we can win."
raj.13.a: "This is the end of the Raj."
raj.13.b: "Freedom for India!"

raj.20.t: "Our Assets in Burma"
raj.20.d: "The current situation in the British Raj is beyond alarming. Armed rebels have seized vast swathes of territory, and while the administration of the Raj is doing everything it can to control the damage with our assistance, it is abundantly clear that they will not be able to protect everything necessary. Our forces are in a position to move quickly and decisively into the jungles of Burma, and to secure the colony under our occupation before Indian rebels can initiate never-ending guerilla warfare in its environment."
raj.20.a: "Occupy Burma immediately!"

raj.21.t: "Britain Occupies Burma"
raj.21.d: "British forces, moving out of Mayalsia and the British East Indies, have occupied Burma, a territory granted to the Raj many years ago. While it is unlikely that the British will ever release it from their occupation, we have much bigger problems to handle at the moment than to lodge complaints with London."
raj.21.a: "They are doing what they must."

raj.22.t: "The Indian Revolt"
raj.22.d: "Unrelenting economic woes, massive loss of life from the Great War, frequent famines, and poor administration which led to a sharp increase in radicalization have all finally culminated in a massive revolt the likes of which haven't been seen on the subcontinent since the Sepoy Rebellion 80 years ago. Whilst massive, the Indian revolt is poorly organized and is made up of dozens of individual factions who all work within relative cooperation with each other, but under the surface exist massive internal divisions which will surely destroy the United Front once there are no foreigners left to fight. \n\nThe issue of intervention has proven to be a divisive issue in Parliament, with both Liberals and Tories on either side of the issue arguing their stances. Full abandonment of India is out of the question, and as such we must choose."
raj.22.a: "We must commit the full forces of our domain to secure India!"
raj.22.b: "India has been hemorrhaging profits for years, we shall send a limited force."

raj.23.t: "Parliament votes on full intervention"
raj.23.d: "After much deliberation in London and further chaos in the Indian subcontinent, we have recieved word that the Britsh military will be "used to the fullest possible extent in order to quell and suppress the rebel forces and capture their leadership". We expect the first British troops to be landing within days, however we cannot expect any help from the other member-states of the Empire, at least not by military means."
raj.23.a: "Reinforcements inbound!"

raj.24.t: "Parliament votes on limited intervention"
raj.24.d: "Failing to grasp the gravity of the situation developing here in India, the British Parliament in London has voted to allow limited military intervention in this Indian Revolt. The "relief" being sent is a meagre stimulus to our collapsed economy and confused military structure. Still, we must make do with what we have."
raj.24.a: "...What?"

raj.30.t: "Plans for a Revolt"
raj.30.d: "Today, our intelligence agents came to our government with extremely troubling news. According to them, the inner circles of the Indian Communist and Nationalist movements, as well as the leaders of several independence movements, are laying the groundwork for a widespread revolt akin to the Indian Revolt of 1857. Planned acts of violence are set to commence in four to eight months, and it appears that as of right now, these leaders do not know that our admistration knows. There is indecision within the government on how to approach this issue. Some ministers are advocating for the immediate arrest of the leaders of these movements, but others argue that cracking down on them would only lead to further unrest, and argue instead that we should immediately bring them to the negotiating table. London has remained silent on the issue thus far. One thing is abundantly clear; we must take steps to mitigate this crisis before it can happen."
raj.30.a: "We have four months to prepare, then."

raj.31.t: "The Revolt Defeated!"
raj.31.d: "The last of the Indian rebels have surrendered. The Revolt which has ravaged the Raj and destroyed countless pounds worth of infrastructure has finally come to an end. While some rebels continue to hold out in small fortifications in the countryside, they no longer pose a threat to our cities and will be dealt with in due time. While we were forced to make sacrifices leading up to the Revolt to prepare for and mitigate it, it appears they ultimately paid off. While the repercurssions of those decisions may yet come to bite us, now is the time to rebuild and recover from the damages that the recent fighting has caused."
raj.31.a: "The Empire prevails once more!"

raj.32.t: "Flight to Ceylon"
raj.32.d: "The Revolt is far stronger than anything we could have anticipated. While troops from across the Empire are sailing across the sea even now to aid us, they may be coming too late. We have lost many of our military installations across the subcontinent, and the rebels gain more followers with every city they take from our control. Our military leaders are desperate now, and are convinced that we have no choice but to abandon the Raj and flee to Ceylon. While Parliament in London is loathe to abandon their largest colony, they have offered us control of the island should we take this plan of action. Of course, neither London nor our leaders expect a flight to Ceylon to be permanent; we would return in force once Parliament is ready to reconquer India. Yet there is the possibility that they will never choose to allow our reconquest, in which case everything we have worked for up until now would be for naught, and it may have been better for us to die here in our final stand."
raj.32.a: "Get us out of here!"
raj.32.b: "No! We will fight to the end!"

raj.33.t: "The Raj Requests a Declaration of War"
raj.33.d: "The exile government of the British Raj in Ceylon has reached out to our government with a request to declare a state of war between the United Kingdom and the breakaway states that have taken over the Indian subcontinent in our absence. While a blanket declaration would usually mean little or less, doing so could endanger our position in the region and take from us what few colonies we have left. Additionally, there are many in our administration who feel that helping the failed state that the Raj has become would just drag us into a prolonged war we can't afford. That being said, taking back India would provide us with all of the resources we lost once more...."
raj.33.a: "The Jewel will be ours once more."
raj.33.b: "They already lost India once. They will not do it again."

raj.40.t: "A Return to Peace"
raj.40.d: "The ruins of some buildings still smolder. Landmines still lie in wait to blow up as farmers step on them, and bombs from the British Airforce still lie undetonated in remote woods and villages. But the fight is over. And the Raj still stands strong. \n\nBut threats remain at our borders. The British Empire has shown that it cares little and less for us, the attempted Revolt has set the world's economy to crashing and burning, and the leaders of the Revolt still evade us. A sizable number of advisers in our administration are demanding we crack down on civil rights and liberties as they currently exist in the country until we can apprehend the at-large leaders. But others, perhaps more wisely, are suggesting that the best way to rebuild and prevent another Revolt from ever happening is to continue on as if nothing had ever happened. That may mean we will never catch those leaders, but it could also mean we would not be further inflaming the passions of the countryside. We must choose wisely; even though we've won, our country is perhaps more fragile than it has ever been."
raj.40.a: "Continue everything as normal. It is the best way to rebuild."
raj.40.b: "Crack down on everything."

raj.41.t: "The Crackdown"
raj.41.d: "In the interest of preserving the peace we have won, our government has instituted a number of measures designed to restrict the rights and freedoms of the people of the Raj until the at-large leaders of the failed rebellion are caught. From now on, speech criticizing the administration of the Raj in any way has been banned - punishable by prison without release. Private citizens are no longer allowed to own firearms, and must submit them to our forces at once. The cities, as well, are now under occupation by the British Indian Army. Protest of any kind has been outlawed. The British themselves have remained largely silent on the issue, but their diplomats have privately told us that these actions are unacceptable. But we no longer have to listen to their complaints. They didn't put down the revolt - we did. And we will decide how to ensure it doesn't happen again."
raj.41.a: "They can have their freedoms back once the perpetrators are caught."

raj.42.t: "Manhunt"
raj.42.d: "So long as any leaders of the failed Revolt remain at large, we risk a second uprising. The British have already shown us that they are unwilling to help put down another rebellion, especially one of the magnitude we just experienced. Unfortunately, our search for these missing leaders remains unfruitful. They have been taking advantage of loyalists in the countryside, as well as the extremely rural nature of the country outside of the cities, to hide themselves. If we have any hope of finding them, we must launch a full-scale manhunt. Deploy soldiers to remote villages. Bribe villagers for information. Infiltrate any remaining networks. And, eventually, find and capture the culprits behind this mess. Then, and only then, can we finally start to relax our guard and return to normal."
raj.42.a: "We will not rest until they are behind bars!"

raj.43.t: "Rebel Leaders Captured"
raj.43.d: "News has reached us today that the remaining leaders of the attempted rebellion have been captured in the countryside. Reports indicate that they were disguised as peasant farmers in Bengal, perhaps hoping to unify with the Indian Communists who some reports indicate remain in hiding here. Regardless of whether the threat of the Indian Communists is real or not, the leaders of the very real recent Revolt are now in our custody. Many are eager to see them put on trial before the whole nation, broadcast over radio as a show trial. A handful, however, are suggesting that we keep any trial out of the public light, so as to heal over our recent wounds."
raj.43.a: "No need to make this a public affair."
raj.43.b: "Let's put on the trial of the century."

raj.44.t: "The Trial of the Century"
raj.44.d: "The rebel leaders we captured were put on trial this week in New Delhi. Huge crowds gathered outside the courthouse, and the army was brought in to preserve the peace. Indians across the country listened in by radio as well, as the state provided an overwhelming amount of evidence against the accused. The outcome is predetermined, of course, but the rebel leaders were still granted a defense. They used most of that time railing against our judiciary system and the governance of the Raj. At one point, the judge of the trial ordered them bound and gagged so they would not further disturb the court's proceedings. The trial has also attracted a number of foreign correspondents, and appears to be attracting coverage across the globe. Our overlords in London have sent us messages appealing for us to keep the trial out of the public eye, but we have so far and will continue to ignore them. Justice must be served."
raj.44.a: "What a show!"

raj.45.t: "Rebel Leaders Sentenced"
raj.45.d: "In a surprise to absolutely no one, all of the rebel leaders have been found guilty by our justice system, and are now subject to sentencing. A number of members of our government are saying that we should literally end the trial of the century with a bang, and execute the leaders to send a final message to those that would defy us in the future. A less vocal handful of advisers are saying that we should offer clemency - not total exoneration, but perhaps lighter prison sentences with the possibility of future parole. Doing so would send a message of reconciliation, but we must decide if that is what we really need at this moment."
raj.45.a: "They are traitors, but clemency should be awarded."
raj.45.b: "They are traitors, and the punishment for treason is death."

raj.46.t: "Protests Against the Sentencing"
raj.46.d: "With the news of the execution of the former leaders of the attempted rebellion spreading throughout the country, protests have spurng up in cities across the Raj. They are demanding reforms to the judiciary system, and calling the recent trial of those leaders nothing less than a sham. While it's obviously too late for us to pardon those leaders, some in our government are suggesting we pay heed to their words and look into reform. At the very least, they argue, we must let the protests continue until they fizzle out on their own. More of our advisers, however, argue for a different approach. They say that leaving these protests as they are will undoubtebly sew more chaos into our cities at a time when we need peace and stability. They argue for cracking down hard on these protests before they can grow too large. All in the name of preserving the peace, of course."
raj.46.a: "It is within their rights to protest."
raj.46.b: "Peace and protest cannot coexist."

raj.47.t: "Retaliation"
raj.47.d: "The protests against the sentencing of the leaders of the attempted rebellion have been crushed. With the help of the British Indian Army, we have arrested and charged hundreds, if not thousands, of the conspirators. While our original plan was to lift our civil rights restrictions after the rebel leaders were captured and executed, that is no longer a possibility. If we are to ensure that such a thing never happens again, these restrictions shall become the new norm. Our administration cannot and shall not be questioned, and any attempt to do so will result in immediate and hard retaliation. We will make it clear that we are in charge here, and that even the very thought of rising up against us will be met with the most brutal of punishments."
raj.47.a: "Long live the British Raj!"

raj.50.t: "Rumblings of Dissent"
raj.50.d: "Our intelligence agency is giving us troubling reports from across the country. Large political groups, many of which we gave autonomy while preparing for the recent Revolt treat, have been gathering en masse. Reports out of Bengal indicate that Indian Communists are intending to hold a massive meeting, while those out of Hyderabad indicate that several Princes are planning to consolidate their power. We are still recovering from the recent threat, and our resources are spread thin. Attempts to crack down on these gatherings may backfire if we go in without proper strength, so for now we must sit back and watch with wariness. We should be able to figure out what they're all up to in the next few days...."
raj.50.a: "Didn't we just go through this?"

raj.51.t: "The Communists Declare Independence"
raj.51.d: "Today, leaders of the Indian Communist Party in Bengal issued a formal 'declaration of independence' from the British Raj. They have laid claims over all of our territory, proclaiming themselves to be the true government of India, though they are localized only to the northeast corner of the country. While they have many devoted followers, and may draw upon protracted warfare efforts, almost everyone in our government is confident in our ability to crush them. Calling in assistance from Britain is essential before going to war with more rebels, but it should be two weeks at the most before we are ready to destroy their 'People's State'."
raj.51.a: "We'll show them what happens to traitors!"
raj.51.b: "Glory to the People's Front!"

raj.52.t: "Hyderabad and Punjab Declare Independence"
raj.52.d: "While we were distracted by the situation in Bengal, further treachery was afoot. Today, leaders in Hyderabad and Punjab declared independence from the British Raj, though neither laid claim to the entire subcontinent as the People's Front did. While Punjab is a largely mountainous, barren region in the northwest, Hyderabad is among the largest and most powerful Princely States within the country. Their secession is damaging beyond compare. Our plans to put down the Communist insurgency in Bengal must wait. We need to determine what our course of action with these new traitors will be."
raj.52.a: "We gave them too much autonomy after all."
raj.52.b: "Glory to Hyderabad!"
raj.52.c: "Glory to Punjab!"

raj.53.t: "Bombay and Rajahstan Declare Independence"
raj.53.d: "Leaders in our government are beginning to panic. Today, rebels in both Bombay and Rajahstan declared independence from the Raj, further crippling our position. We are now in frequent and desperate communications with London to try and circumvent any further uprisings. It appears that by attempting to mitigate the revolt our intelligence agencies told us about, we have empowered a series of peaceful but enforced secession movements that we may be powerless to stop."
raj.53.a: "This wasn't supposed to happen."
raj.53.b: "Glory to Bombay!"
raj.53.c: "Glory to Rajahstan!"

raj.54.t: "Orissa Declares Independence"
raj.54.d: "Yet another rebel state has declared independence from the Raj today, this time in Orissa. More and more people are rapidly leaving our rule, and we suddenly find ourselves on very precarious ground. Our only remaining power base is in the country's south, and should more rebels rise there, we may effectively see the end of the British Raj as a state. London is refusing to send more soldiers our way until the situation becomes clearer, which means we are suddenly on our own in deciding how to handle this crisis."
raj.54.a: "Stop them!"
raj.54.b: "Glory to Orissa!"

raj.55.t: "The Raj Collapses"
raj.55.d: "Our government has been sent into a free-fall. Five more pretender states have declared independence from the Raj today, all backed by substantial independent militias and security funding. It's clear now that we made a terrible mistake in trying to mitigate the revolt. In attempting to mitigate something that was ultimately no more than a handful of militias, we threw away any control we still maintained over the subcontinent. We have failed, and we can only hope and pray now that we may hold onto the rest of our territory, and someday return to the power we once held."
raj.55.a: "This will be the end of the Raj."
raj.55.b: "Glory to Baluchistan!"
raj.55.c: "Glory to Mysore!"
raj.55.d: "Glory to Madras!"
raj.55.e: "Glory to Tranvacore!"
raj.55.f: "Glory to Bihar!"

raj.56.t: "The End of the British Raj"
raj.56.d: "The leaders within our administration are fleeing the capital in any way they can. Smoke rises from government offices as documents are burned. Loved ones are left behind, and those that choose to remain know they face persecution, perhaps death. London has set up what essentially amounts to a Raj-in-exile in Ceylon, though the small island has little in the way of people or resouces. A Provisional Indian government, headed by the Nationalist wing of the Indian National Congress, has risen up in and around New Delhi, claiming control over all of India, but it is extremely unlikely that they will ever be able to unite the continent again. We are forced to leave the continent knowing that our failure has destroyed the greatest colony in British history. Our future is uncertain, our past a tragedy."
raj.56.a: "This is the beginning of the end for the British Empire."
raj.56.b: "Glory to India!"
raj.56.c: "Glory to Kashmir!"

raj.60.t: "Our Troubled Future"
raj.60.d: "The stormclouds of the Indian Revolt are now behind us. But that does not mean our future will be any kinder. The Raj faces unprecedented levels of resentment, and the autonomy we granted to local movements to avoid the Revolt is proving troublesome to take away. The British continue to feed off of us to fuel their Imperial efforts abroad, and a sizable chunk of the population - including some members of our own administration - support complete and total independence from London altogether. Navigating these upcoming trials and tribulations will not be easy. Our nation may yet break before the decade's end. But we have already survived one catastrophe. We can survive another."
raj.60.a: "We will work with the British."
raj.60.b: "We will not rest until we have independence."

raj.80.t: "Status of the British Indian Army"
raj.80.d: "The British Indian Army has long been a tool by the British to keep their Indian colony satiated. By nominally making the Army under the command of Indian officers, the British are able to use the army to subdue unrest in the Raj without appearing as an invading force. With the recent Revolt, however, we may want to re-examine how exactly this army is used. Some in our administration have argued to continue using it as a nominally Indian army, some going so far as to suggest that we hand it over completely to the control of Indian officers. Others, however, have suggested that it would be far more useful if it were to be turned into a completely British occupation force."
raj.80.a: "Maintain Indian Control"
raj.80.b: "Increase British Involvement"

raj.81.t: "Status of Our Industry"
raj.81.d: "Our nation's industry has been ravaged by Europeans for years. The British, with the aid of their East India Company, have slaved our factories and production to their markets for more than a century, and as such, the things we make leave our country, and our people are left behind. If our ultimate goal is to revitalize our industry and making it work for our people instead of those back in Europe, we will have a lot of work to do to begin revitalizing our industry and taking back what is rightfully ours."
raj.81.a: "Sounds like we have a lot of work to do."

raj.82.t: "Legacy of the East India Company"
raj.82.d: "For centuries now, we have been little more than a plaything for the monstrous economy of the British Empire. We supply cotton for the home isles, and the riches that flow out of our nation often line the pockets of British men back in Europe. The East India Company's legacy shall be defined by what it has done to us. Through it, the British essentially bought our country away from us, and used it to suppress us for nearly two hundred years. Now, as we recover from our recent struggles and begin to chart a new path forward, we must re-evaulate the EIC's legacy, and decide what to do with the scars it has left on our country."
raj.82.a: "We must decide whether to embrace or reject this legacy."

raj.83.t: "Our Industry Improves"
raj.83.d: "All of our hard work over the past few months is finally beginning to pay off. Our industry is once more within our own control, and while we still have much work to due to fully overcome the damage the British have done over the centuries, just producing Indian goods for Indian people has given us a newfound excitement as we create our new nation."
raj.83.a: "Long live India!"

raj.84.t: "The Raj Requests Reparations"
raj.84.d: "Our diplomats in the British Raj received an odd request today. The government of the Raj is requesting reparations from us for the 'one and a half centuries of British suppression and hijacking of Indian industry.' They are referencing, of course, the East India Company, which is functionally no more but which helped us consolidate control over the Indian subcontinent a century ago. The reparations they are requesting are staggeringly huge, but in all likelihood they aren't actually expecting us to agree. Still, it might be worth sending a little money their way to placate them. We never did anything wrong, of course, but it's a small price to pay to keep them from revolting again."
raj.84.a: "We can work out the details in a few years."

raj.85.t: "Transition to Dominionhood"
raj.85.d: "There is cheering in the streets. Entire parades of people fill the avenues and boulevards of every major city, from Dhaka to Karachi. Hindus and Muslims alike celebrated as the new flag of the new Dominion of India was raised above every building in the country. Granted, for every ten people celebrating there was one Hindu or Muslim nationalist solemnly watching with a hate-filled gaze, or one British opportunist who continues to gripe about the specifics of independence and the new nations - or lack thereof - that would adorn the maps of South Asia. But above all, there is a common thread: we have won. We have forced the singe greatest imperial power in the world to accede to us. The very nation that once destroyed everything that Indian society had built over millennia was now forced to bow down and grant it the sovereignty it so desperately deserved. Reporters from every major nation swarmed New Delhi, desperate to get quotes from officials and citizens. Indeed, the world is watching, and waiting to see how we approach and overcome the trials and tribulations ahead of us. But for now, we need only worry about - and celebrate - one thing: our Dominionhood."
raj.85.a: "Long live the Dominion of India!"

raj.86.t: "The Raj Demands Independence"
raj.86.d: "Demands from the leaders of various Indian movements in the British Raj reached our foreign ministry today. They are all alike. They demand independence and the recognition of a sovereign Indian state. The Raj will be dissolved, and our colonial presence in south Asia limited to just Ceylon and Burma. They warn us that continued occupation of the subcontinent is not sustainable, and that the revolt that was planned in 1936 would just be a taste of the resentment to come if we remain. Attached notes from our administration in the colony confirm that these are not empty threats. Governance of the Raj has become extremely difficult, and a majority of those in the administration there agree that political independence is the best way to go to avoid embarassment further down the line. A very small minority (just one minister really), say that we should invade the country properly and put this independence nonsense down for good. But that is disastrous policy, and will only hurt us more. The best move is to have Parliament grant them some path to indpendence. May God help us all."
raj.86.a: "The time has come. Let's let them go."
raj.86.b: "Enough of this nonsense. They will be crushed."

raj.87.t: "Parliament Grants Us A Path to Independence"
raj.87.d: "Fantastic news has reached us out of London. Our diplomats are ecstatic, for Parliament has granted us a path to national and political independence. Any celebration over the decision was shortlived in the Raj, though. The Indian people still have a series of hoops that London has seen fit to make them jump through before they are able to fully claim independence. The British are making it very clear that this is their own decision, done out of the kindness of their imperial hearts, perhaps to save face. That doesn't matter now. What matters now is negotiating the terms of their withdrawal, and beginning to negotiate among the Indian people to determine how the new nation will look. Already there is talk and dissent over partitioning the country between Hindus and Muslims. One thing is clear, though. Independence will come. The question now is how long it will take."
raj.87.a: "We're nearly there."

raj.90.t: "Lord Linlithgow Arrives in India" #April 1936
raj.90.d: "Lord Victor Alexander John Hope, 2nd arquess of Linlithgow, arrived by ship in Bombay today. Linlithgow was appointed by the British government to take this position after Lord Willingdon resigned late last year, but didn't deign to leave England until recently. Linlithgow served on the comissions that drafted the flawed and failed Governent of India Act last year, so why he was chosen to be the colony's new Viceroy is beyond the current administration's understanding. Yet with his arrival, the current governing Council finds itself more limited in the scope of its powers. If we are to avoid the coming Revolt, we would do well not to offend him. As his ship docks in the harbor and he sets foot into India for the first time, the best we can hope for from Linlithgow is that he takes the current threat seriously."
raj.90.a: "You have work to get to, Viceroy."

raj.91.t: "Indian Independence Parties Win Provincial Elections" #1937, sometime after end of Revolt
raj.91.d: "While elections were delayed due to the Revolt we faced and ultimately defeated, Lord Linlithgow's government was able to declare and hold elections for the Indian Legislature, a largely elitist body with little actual power. It was with complete surprise, therefore, that the government received results from across the country detailing a surge of support for a variety of Indian independence parties, which splintered off of the old Indian National Congress and which have long pushed for further Indian sovereignty and autonomy. Lord Linlithgow himself has privately expressed that he views this outcome as a slap in the face; it seems as if putting down the Revolt did not put down the calls for more radical change from the populace. While some in our administration have called for us to petition London to strip the legislature of what legislative powers it does possess, doing so would only cause trouble where little currently exists. We will just have to accept greater Indian political influence as it is."
raj.91.a: "They just never quit, do they?"

raj.100.t: "The Raj Requests A Path to Dominion Status"
raj.100.d: "Delegates from the British Raj arrived in London today with a rather odd request. They petitioned our government to grant the Raj a path to Dominionhood, alike to the Dominions of Canada, South Africa, Australia, and New Zealand. In the past, this would have been unheard of - the Raj has always existed purely for our exploitation, though we of course don't frame it that way. However, the situation there has gotten out of hand in recent years. The planned revolt, and the fracture of the country, has left many in both Parliament and our Ministries wondering if it remains feasible to maintain a stranglehold on the subcontinent. It would likely take years for the Raj to meet all of the requirements for Dominionhood proposed by our Ministries, but even offering to grant the nation this much autonomy will have many on the right up in arms. India remains 'the jewel of the Empire' for a reason, and to willingly relinquish so much of our power at once is something that has never been done in British history. All this being said, it would be much worse for our image - both domestically and internationally - if another revolt were to tear the country out of our hands forcefully. In that case, we would lose everything."
raj.100.a: "We shall grant them a path."
raj.100.b: "It's out of the question."

raj.101.t: "Britain Grants Our Request"
raj.101.d: "No one in our government expected London to grant us a path to Dominionhood. So when the news reached New Delhi, everyone was shocked. The Ministers lucky enough to be in the Governor General's office said nothing for a long, long time. Requesting Dominion status had been the longest shot possible - so much of a reach that it should have been impossible! And yet, the message from the Isles was clear. The Raj was being granted a path."
raj.101.a: "Then let us begin!"

raj.102.t: "Britain Denies Our Request"
raj.102.d: "No one in our government expected London to grant us a path to Dominionhood, so it was no surprise when the news reached New Delhi. Still, there was an air of disappointment in the air in the Governor General's office. Requesting Dominion status had been the last-ditch attempt to ease tensions without becoming a police state. And without a path to that far-fetched dream, we must needs turn our attention away from London and back to the matter at hand."
raj.102.a: "Typical."

raj.103.t: "A Commission for the Raj's Transition"
raj.103.d: "The transition of the British Raj from a colony to a Dominion is guaranteed to be a long and arduous process. Our Ministries will have to set up numerous criteria for the country to meet before it can hope to become self-governing. We will need to maintain some semblence of control over trade of the country's resources, and some way to step in if they install an anti-British valkist. However, even these minimal requirements may be difficult to achieve. The Indian delegation has come to us and proposed that a Commission be established to guide the Raj through the criteria of Dominionhood. While this in itself was something we were going to do regardless of their request, they went further by insisting that they be represented on the commission by one of their leaders - a man by the name of Sitaramayya. Those further to the right in our government have dismissed the request as out of hand, and say that only a fully British Commission can decide the terms of Dominionhood. Yet there may be something to be said about having Indian representation present..."
raj.103.a: "Set up an all-British commission."
raj.103.b: "Allow the Indians representation in the commission."

raj.110.t: "Gradual Independence"
raj.110.d: "We have finally achieved all of the criteria set out by the Parliament in London to become an independent nation. The Commission has had its final meeting and declared the British Raj 'ready for independence.' Final word has come in from London, as well. Five years from today, India will be officially and irrevocably free. In that time, our government will be tasked with making the smooth transition to the incoming Indian-led government. In one year, the British will withdraw from their largest colony. In one year, the Raj will be no more. In one year..."
raj.110.a: "...India will be free."

raj.111.t: "Indian Independence"
raj.111.d: "Despite our current, much larger, issues, we must still decide how to deal with the question of Indian independence. With the Raj all but guaranteed to leave the Empire within a few years, we must decide how to approach its departure. Some in our government have said that we should just allow the Indians to handle their own affairs. Others, however, have been much more vocal about an alternative solution. The current divide between Hindu and Muslim Indians could escalate into a devastating conflict in the future, and these members of our government are suggesting that widespread research and planning be put into a possible partition of India, so that such a conflict might be avoided. Doing so would take valuable time and resources on our part, but it may be the right thing to do if we hope to ensure future stability in the region."
raj.111.a: "Release India As One State"
raj.111.b: "Partition India"
raj.111.c: "Let the Indians Handle Their Own Affairs."

raj.112.t: "Partitioning India"
raj.112.d: "Releasing India as a single entity would be disastrous - not just for our dominance in the region, but also for the citizens of the Raj themselves. There are too many ethnic and religious differences to enable the creation of a single, stable state. The two biggest ethnic groups, fortunately, are largely clustered into three areas. Both Bengal and Punjab are Muslim-majority areas, while the rest of the country is Hindu-majority. It is now up to us to decide how to divide up the Raj. Some are advocating for splitting it between Punjab, Bengal, and the rest of the country. Others, however, advocate for only releasing one or the other rather than both, fearing that a war between the two and India could be disastrous. Others say that only by releasing both can we avoid a humanitarian crisis and millions upon millions of displaced persons. What shall we do?"
raj.112.a: "Release Just Bengal"
raj.112.b: "Release Just Punjab"
raj.112.c: "Release both Bengal and Punjab"

raj.113.t: "Dividing The Country"
raj.113.d: "The British have taken the unprecedented step of allowing us to determine our own future. While many are celebrating this as a good omen for the future of our new nation, others continue to urge caution, and some have even go so far as to advocate for a voluntary division of the nation. These advisers are concerned that, once the celebrations of our independence have passed, ethnic and religious divides will rear their heads and spark a conflict that could kill millions. They suggest that dividing India between majority-Hindu and majority-Muslim areas is the best course of action. Others, however, continue to push for maintaining a united India, both to project as much strength as possible as the world's youngest nation, and to dissuade potential attacks by the superpowers that still surround us. What path shall we take?"
raj.113.a: "We can work out our issues together."
raj.113.b: "We should create several states."

raj.114.t: "Dividing India"
raj.114.d: "India has long been a massive and diverse state. But so far, most ethnic and religious violence has been dissuaded by a heavy British military presence. With the British leaving soon, however, we must face the problems that will confront us when they do. The best way to avoid violence between our Hindu and Muslim brothers is to divide the country, but there are questions on how many divisions should be made. Muslim Indians are mainly concentrated in two areas: Bengal and Punjab. Some have therefore suggested creating three states altogether, but others have said we should just release one or the other, not both, in the interest of our future as a nation. Releasing both would likely avert the worst of a humanitarian refugee crisis, but releasing only one may be necessary to keep as many resources as possible and defend against threats in the future. Whatever we choose, we will be defining the future of South Asia here and now."
raj.114.a: "Release Just Bengal"
raj.114.b: "Release Just Punjab"
raj.114.c: "Release both Bengal and Punjab"

raj.115.t: "Independence Day"
raj.115.d: "There is cheering in the streets. Entire parades of people fill the avenues and boulevards of every major city, from Dhaka to Karachi. Hindus and Muslims alike celebrated as the new flag of the Indian state was raised above every building in the country. Granted, for every ten people celebrating there was one British officer solemnly packing his bags, or one extremist who continues to gripe about the specifics of independence and the new nations - or lack thereof - that would adorn the maps of South Asia. But above all, there is a common thread: we have won. We have forced the singe greatest imperial power in the world to accede to us. The very nation that once destroyed everything that Indian society had built over millennia was now forced to bow down and grant it the independence it so desperately deserved. Reporters from every major nation swarmed New Delhi, desperate to get quotes from officials and citizens. Indeed, the world is watching, and waiting to see how we approach and overcome the trials and tribulations ahead of us. But for now, we need only worry about - and celebrate - one thing: our freedom."
raj.115.a: "Long Live India!"

#Events
hyd.1.t: "The Dawn of an Old Nation"
hyd.1.d: "The Princely State of Hyderabad first came into being in 1724, and its history has been long and not unmarked by mistakes. It was the first Princely State to enter into a dominion under the British, setting into motion the events that created the British Raj. Yet today, Hyderabad once again stands independent. \n\nHyderabad was once, and quite possibly still remains, the wealthiest Princely State in all of India. We have tremendous amounts of resources at our disposal, and our economy alone could carry us into the future. Of course, things are not always as simple as who has the most money. We are surrounded by threats on all sides. The Communists seek to conquer all of India, and the British may always return to attempt their own reconquest. Our wealth can help us find new friends and allies, though there are other proposals that some in our government offer that we may be wise to heed. The new India is fractured, yes, but if we play our cards right, we could be the state that pieces it back together."
hyd.1.a: "Long live Hyderabad!"

hyd.20.t: "Princely Relations"
hyd.20.d: "The Prince of Hyderabad has sent envoys to severl nations, including our own. While we are no longer members of the same nation, they are offering us diplomatic friendship and reconciliation. Perhaps this is how they intend to survive in the post-Raj world - by building friendships and alliances to keep them afloat. Some in our government argue that we have no need of Hyderabad's friendship, but a much more vocal majority advocate for accepting the envoys and sending several of our own in return. After all, we are all still brothers of the subcontinent, and infighting will get us nowhere but under the thumb of another imperial power."
hyd.20.a: "They are our brothers; we stand with them."
hyd.20.b: "Tell them we're not looking for another overlord."

hyd.21.t: "Creation of a Defensive Pact"
hyd.21.d: "Envoys from our new friends in Hyderabad have once again arrived at our doorstep. This time, however, their proposal is radically different. They are suggesting the creation of a defensive pact of Princely States; a pact that would aid each other in warfare. Such a pact would undoubtedly be helpful against forces like the Indian People's State and their attempted reconquest, or the potential return of the British or another European power. But some in our government worry that this is only the first step on a long and slippery slope - one which could lead to us giving away our newfound autonomy as a nation. As those in support are quick to point out, however, we may lose that autonomy through force if we try to stand on our own..."
hyd.21.a: "Yes, we could use the help."
hyd.21.b: "We can take care of ourselves."

hyd.22.t: "Another Invite to the Princely Pact"
hyd.22.d: "Hyderabad has extended yet another invitation to us to join their defensive 'Princely Pact.' We have already told them no once, and we would be well within our rights to do so again. But some members of our government remain adament that we reconsider the offer, especially with the new global developments."
hyd.22.a: "We've changed our mind; we'll join."
hyd.22.b: "We've already told them no!"

hyd.122.t: "Adoption of a Common Currency"
hyd.122.d: "Hyderabad's envoys have come to us with a rather bizarre proposal. They are suggesting that the member states of the Princely Pact band together to create a common Indian currency. It would certainly streamline trade, and provide a buffer for our struggling economy. But doing so would effectively cede a major part of our autonomy as a nationstate. A majority of our advisers are arguing that we accept the offer, especially considering the boost it would give to our economy. But a sizable minority are against the proposal, arguing that by switching to a common currency we are effectively placing our financial future in the hands of a number of foreign nations that are just as new to the world as we are."
hyd.122.a: "This will save us a lot of trouble."
hyd.122.b: "We will be fine without this."

hyd.23.t: "Formation of a Common Market"
hyd.23.d: "It appears that a common currency was not enough for the government of Hyderabad. They, joined with a few other governments of the Princely Pact, have suggested that we join together in a common market. This sort of thing has not really been seen in the world yet, but would involve ending all tariffs against each other's imports and exports and essentially acting as a unified bloc in global trade. Being on a common currency, as we are, would make a transition to this system much easier, but many in our government are saying that this is a step too far for the Pact. They argue that we joined this Pact purely for national defense purposes, and that forming a common economic market would only cede the very national sovereignty we fought for to Hyderabad and its allies. Those in support argue that we are one of those allies, and that by forming a common market we are only taking another step towards a common goal of a united and free Indian union."
hyd.23.a: "Let us unite our economies."
hyd.23.b: "This is unnecessary."

hyd.24.t: "Formation of a Federation"
hyd.24.d: "A mixture of euphoria and outrage greeted the arrival of Hyderabad's latest proposal. The leader of the Princely Pact has suggested that the defensive alliance take a step towards political unification. The exact proposal would have all of the members of the Pact joining together in what is in essence an Indian Federation. A legislature made up of representatives from every member state would pass laws pertaining to the common market and defense, though individual nations would be left to their own devices on matters of domestic importance. A number of our ministers - though they are in the minority - are arguing that joining this Federation is the wisest move we could take to draw one step closer to the ultimate goal of a united and free Indian state. But a majority of others are adament that by agreeing to this proposal, we would ensure that our sovereignty as a state would be moot, and that we would be ceding all of our power to a number of bureaucrats in Hyderabad."
hyd.24.a: "The Pact will stand ever stronger!"
hyd.24.b: "We will not sacrifice our independence."

hyd.25.t: "Centralization of the Pact"
hyd.25.d: "The united legislature of the Indian Federation has passed a proposal for ratification by all of its member states. This proposal would effectively centralize the Federation's powers, putting matters once left to the individual states in the hands of the legislature in Hyderabad. Those that support this motion in our government are few in number, but they vocally argue that agreeing to this proposal is the only way to create a single state strong enough to withstand European incursions in the future. A much larger majority of advisers are saying that voting yes on this centralization would destroy our country, and strip away what autonomy we haven't already given up. If this measure is ratified, and the Princely Pact becomes nothing short of a fully-fledged 'United States of India,' everything we have fought for as a fledgling new nation would be put at risk."
hyd.25.a: "We support this proposal."
hyd.25.b: "We shall not cede our autonomy!"

hyd.26.t: "The Reunification"
hyd.26.d: "The legislature of the Indian Federation has just passed a proposal that would unify every member state of the Princely Pact into a single, cohesive nation. There are many in our government who lament this decision, and who curse us for ceding so much of our power to the Federation to begin with, but they understand as well as anyone else that, short of full-blown rebellion, we are powerless to stop the integration. There are some in our government, though, who are ecstatic. This, they say, is the culmination of years of planning and resistance. A single, unified, and free Indian Federation that will rule South Asia for all time to come. Let the Empires of Europe, or the communists or nationalists break upon our united shores. This is the India that many millions have dreamed of, and it is finally time to make those dreams into a reality."
hyd.26.a: "India Shall Rise Again!"
hyd.26.b: "We've come too far to stop this now."

hyd.100.t: "The Indian Federation"
hyd.100.d: "A state of shock has fallen over Hyderabad. Members of our government can't seem to believe that we have actually pulled off a true reunification of India. Yet there is cheering throughout the new Federation, and we have a new nation to lead. \n\nThe last few states of the Princely Pact ratified the Federation Parliament's most recent move, meaning that a significant part of India has been reunited once more. But things are different now. No longer are we ruled by the whims of a single monarch, or exploited by a faraway Empire. Now we rule ourselves, as a Federation of states. This was how India was always meant to be ruled. There will be challenges in the future, no doubt. There will be infighting and squabbling among the states of this new nation. But we will always be victorious in the end. Because when true trouble rears its head - when the Communists attempt to come after us, or the British decide the time for reconquest has come, we will be ready. And we will be united."
hyd.100.a: "Long live India!"
