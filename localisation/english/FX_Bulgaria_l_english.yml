BUL_FUHRERREDUX_DESC: "The young Bulgarian nation joined the Central Powers in the Great War, declaring war on Serbia in October 1915; despite achieving its territorial objectives, the capitulation of the German Empire proved to have catastrophic effects as Entente forces took back its hard won gains.\n\nThe monarchy was abolished with the capitulation of Bulgarian forces; and the new Republic finally surrendered to the Entente, humiliated and torn apart in the Treaty of Neuilly-sur-Seine in 1920."

Major world governments continue to warn against the potential consequences of moving Bulgaria down such a path. But whether or not they act on their threats is a matter to be seen. For now, both the government and the population at large find themselves wondering the same thing: Will Bulgaria strengthen its position on the world stage, or will it fall victim to the timeless effects of Western interventionism?

	bulgaria.8.d: "After our embassador's speech, about the demands we posed, the coward Greek Nation, decided they'd be better of giving us Thrace, than risking a war.

The Bulgarian state was under Ottoman rule, untill  3rd March 1878, when they became free from the Ottomans. Today [GetDateStringNoHourLong], our leader [BUL.GetLeader] announced the formation of the Third Empire. The world looks with shock and awe upon the valiant people of this Balkan nation who, despite all odds managed to reclaim their birthright and empire.

### FOCUS

	BUL_reclamation: "Reclaim what we lost"
	BUL_reclamation_desc: "Stemming from rapid development and deployment of our armed forces, Bulgaria has now found itself on the path to reclaiming the old titular status of "The Prussia of the Balkans." With all eyes on this once insignificant state, it is now time to choose how we utilize our growing strength to approach the nations foreign ambitions."
	BUL_reclaim_peacefully: "The path of Diplomacy"
	BUL_reclaim_peacefully_desc: "The Balkans: For too long a powder keg and hotspot for international conflicts and proxy wars. Our history is riddled with significant military miracles, and horrifying defeats at the hands of our enemies. But yet it has been decided. It is time we showed the world our capabilities, and restored peace to this troubled region, once and for all."
	BUL_man_the_guns: "Man The Guns"
	BUL_man_the_guns_desc: "Western interventionism and frequent military conflicts between various ethnic groups has decimated a region once capable of prosperity. As of now, peace in the Balkans is but a dream - something philosophers imagine in their past time; something seemingly unreachable. If we are to ever achieve unity in the region, then we must put an end to these petty conflicts. The military is ready. It is time for the last great push. It is time to show the world what we are truly capable of."
	BUL_territorial_ambitions_fulfilled: "Territorial Ambitions Fulfilled"
	BUL_territorial_ambitions_fulfilled_desc: "Throughout the centuries, Bulgaria has been forced to surrender its rightful lands at the hands of powers far greater than ourselves. From the Kievan Rus and the Byzantines, to the Ottomans and the Germans, we have been forced too many times into servitude. But no longer. Through skilled leadership and the decisive force of our military, we have reclaimed lands long thought lost. Never again will we kneel to foreign masters. Bulgaria is for Bulgarians, now and forever."

## ROMAN EMPIRE FOCUS 
	BUL_empire_greek_bulgarian: "A Roman Empire"
	BUL_empire_greek_bulgarian_desc: "After the fall of the Byzantines, our Empire claimed the title of the Third Rome until the Turkish onslaught. Our Czars always protected the orthodox legacy of the Romans even during these trying times. Today we are among the most powerful Nations of the Balkans in a position to reunite the Orthodox world. After we threw off the Muslim tyrants together with our brothers in arms and faith we are bound by destiny to bring back what always belonged together, to reclaim and ascend to the throne in Constantinople, the beating heart of both of our cultures."
	BUL_incite_uprising_gre: "Incite Uprsing in Greece"
	BUL_incite_uprising_gre_desc: "The old always needs to make room for the new and for our great Idea to succeed and finally bring our people together, we need to remove this obstacle to the unity of our people, the warmongering old Guard that wishes for nothing more then to divide the heirs to Rome and orthodoxy. Luckily many Greeks see alike and we will support our friends in their endeavours on their side of the border."
	BUL_alliance_greece: "An Alliance with Greece"
	BUL_alliance_greece_desc: "After our allies in Greece succeeded and have done away with the rotten structure, their nation is finally able to join us in our common destiny to reclaim the legacy of our people and the heart of Orthodoxy."

	BUL_demand_constantinople_desc: "The vile Muslim powers have long enough squatted in the holy halls of Orthodoxy and the great city of Constantine. We will offer them a final demand and chance to withdraw from European soil peacefully at least for now. Our brave soldiers are ready either way."
	BUL_question_of_turkey: "The Question of Turkey"
	BUL_question_of_turkey_desc: "Now that we reduced Turkey to a fully Turkish rump state, the Question remains on what to do with them, we cant let them be there, as they will always be a thorn in our side and an open invitation for our enemies. While we need to have control over the area, full occupation could be a costly and unnecessary endeavour for our manpower which will be needed elsewhere. Alternatively we could set up a controllable puppet in [TUR.GetName], but this would mean that the land won't be directly occupied by us."
	BUL_integrate_anatolia: "Integrate Anatolia"
	BUL_integrate_anatolia_desc: "We will use the remaining orthodox population as the backbone of our reintegration process of Asia Minor. The Area has long been neglected and was under Turkish rule so it will be important to solidify our new order there forst before we advance further."
