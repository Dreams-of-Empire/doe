### History
SWI_FUHRERREDUX_DESC: "The country of Switzerland has never engaged in a foreign war in over a century- not since the era of Napoleon. What had been over two decades of status quo liberal dominance was tested last year, with the General Strike of 1935. While Switzerland is still stable, the memory of this socialist agitation and possible future German aggression leaves this Alpine nation with many friends, but few allies..."

#### Ideas ####

SWI_arms_industry: "The Swiss Arms Industry"
SWI_arms_industry_desc: "Switzerland is renowned for its excellent armsmiths and weapons crafters. Using a hierarchical factory and apprenticeship program native almost entirely to Switzerland, the country has seemingly perfected the factory-to-field production method."
SWI_die_schweizer_armee: "Die Schweizer Armee"
SWI_die_schweizer_armee_desc: "The Schweizer Armee (Swiss Armed Forces) acts as the bulk of Swiss land forces. Volunteers are accepted from people over 18 years of age and service is compulsory for those over 20 years of age. Although it is hardly intended to ever be found in a position that would require offensive maneuvers, it is well armed and thanks to conscription policies properly manned."
SWI_the_swiss_banking_act: "Swiss Banking Act"
SWI_the_swiss_banking_act_desc: "Signed on 1 December 1933, the Swiss Banking Act was created in an effort to secure the assets of account holders within Switzerland. The act was a reactionary measure against the French intervention in the Rhineland, which saw many foreign assets in the region shut down and their profits seized. The Banking Act has made it a criminal offense for a bank to reveal the name of an account holder, and proved very effective when both the French and German governments pressed the Swiss to reveal the names of certain accounts which had ties to the industrial Rhine region."
SWI_swiss_neutrality: "Swiss Neutrality"
SWI_swiss_neutrality_desc: "The Swiss state has a proud tradition of not engaging in foreign wars, one which has not been broken since the era of Napoleon.

### EVENTS ###
swi.1.d: "For the past century, since the era of Napoleon, the Swiss nation has not engaged in a foreign war. While The Great War almost brought our nation to the brink of the maelstrom a couple of times, no threat was ever enough to ensure that we had no choice. Our country has continued to develop upward and onward- while the Swiss Banking Act gave small but continuous profit from one of our most influential trade sectors, some socialist agitation in the form of the SPdS led to one of the most devastating strikes in recent memory, which shut down many factories and rail systems. Negotiations were swift and bloodless, but the divide was no less felt. Through three successive elections, the Federal Council, has seen no change, and a joint Freisinnig-Demokratische Partei/Christlichdemokratische Volkpartei coalition rules this country. The liberal order remains strong, and our enemies are few! Even as we approach the next decade, we remain strong in Our Glorious Alps."
swi.2.d: "The French and the Germans are both remilitarizing- but one clearly moreso than the other. Two wonderful markets ready for product- and we must enter it first!"
swi.3.d: "The Swiss Government has bought several domestically produced guns, and would like to sell them to us. Their prices are wanting, but the product is no less powerful..."
swi.4.d: "The Swiss Government has bought several domestically produced guns, and would like to sell them to us. Their prices are wanting, but the product is no less powerful..."
swi.5.d: "The Swiss government, who is entering the arms market on a state level, offered weaponry to the French over us! What is our next step, for surely we will not let this slip by unnoticed."
swi.6.d: "The Swiss government, who is entering the arms market on a state level, offered weaponry to the Germans over us! What is our next step, for surely we will not let this slip by unnoticed."
swi.7.d: "Our weapons sales have given fabulous profit."
swi.8.d: "The French, angered at our sale of weapons to the 'enemy' have demanded that we come to the tables of Annecy and sign an agreement never to sell guns to the Germans ever again."
swi.9.d: "The Germans, angered at our sale of weapons to the 'enemy' have demanded that we come to the tables of Munich and sign an agreement never to sell guns to the French ever again."
swi.10.d: "We can be more than agreeable to the French demands- thought not as they currently are. These are negotiations, surely, and not a tyrannic enforcement."
swi.11.d: "The Swiss have protested at our treaty and believe that it is restrictive, and that it constitutes a form of economic warfare against smaller nations abroad."
swi.12.d: "The French have agreed to renegotiate the treaty! More telegrams are to follow shortly, no doubt..."
swi.13.d: "We can be more than agreeable to the German demands- thought not as they currently are. Surely, they are not trying to agress us?"
swi.14.d: "The Swiss have protested at our treaty and believe that it is restrictive, and that it constitutes a form of economic warfare against smaller nations abroad."
swi.15.d: "The Germans have agreed to renegotiate the treaty! More telegrams are to follow shortly, no doubt..."
swi.16.d: "The political landscape over the past several months has focused on Gun Apprenticeships and their place within the Swiss economy. While many work sectors have implemented apprenticeship programs, apprenticeships in the arms industry have been targeted at younger gunsmiths as well, which, while boosting the arms industry, has a measurable amount of accidents and harm. What should we do about it?"
swi.17.d: "The Swiss have offered a cut of our foreign shipments if we allow them to lease our state-owned ports to sell their products."
swi.18.d: "The Italians are allowing us to finally use their ports! Our economy can now focus on an international, rather than strictly European, market. No more middlemen!"
swi.19.d: "The Italians will not lease their ports to us without a better payment. We don't seem to have many options here..."
swi.20.d: "The Italians have denied us access to their ports, citing that we should stick to domestic companies to see their products to neighboring countries instead of trying to take advantage of state ports."
swi.21.d: "The Swiss have agreed to our... negotiations."
swi.22.d: "The Swiss have denied our offer to open the ports for a stiff tax. Surely they realize that these are our rightful ports? What right do they have to claim them!"
swi.23.d: ""
swi.24.d: "The ethnically French Swiss of the Western portion of Switzerland have been observing the French elections intently over the past several weeks. Since it's conclusion, our government has seen a radical spike in French seperatist thought."
swi.25.d: ""
swi.26.d: "The Swiss have sent us several diplomatic missions in the past week to mediate peace between our nation and theirs. It seems to be working famously."

swi.30.d: "Our shipments are ready to be sent abroad. Now we just need a foreign state that will promote our prodcts in their market..."
swi.31.d: "The Swiss have come to us with a deal- civilian products for their arms. They claim to be offering us a better deal than the competition..."
swi.32.d: "Our most recent offer was accepted! We now have a state sponsoring our industry."
swi.33.d: "The Swiss, who previously offered weapons deals to the Americans, have come to us to see if out government would like to purchase their goods, including guns, for civilian products."
swi.34.d: "The Swiss, who previously offered weapons deals to the Americans and British, have come to us to see if out government would like to purchase their goods, including guns, for civilian products."
swi.35.d: "The Swiss, who previously offered weapons deals to the Americans, British, and Japanese, have come to us to see if out government would like to purchase their goods, including guns, for civilian products."
swi.36.d: "The Swiss, who previously offered weapons deals to the Americans, British, Japanese, and Manchurians, have come to us to see if out government would like to purchase their goods, including guns, for civilian products."
swi.37.d: "In a stunning twist, no country in the world to which we have offered our products has accepted. These shipments will have to stay in port, at least for now."
swi.38.d: "Astonishgly, the final copy of the syndicated 'Il Matire di Roma', the now infamous stage production based on the life of Benito Mussolini, one of the lead socialists behind Italy's Red Year and perennial Red martyr, was seized by state police when they raided the house of suspected socialist revolutionaries, of the same varity that sparked the riots and strikes of 1935. Even now, the leaders of several unions, have offered to purchase the copy from the government once the case has ended against the so-labeled 'revolutionaries'. What should our response be?"
swi.39.d: "Habsburg royalty from various coutries, including Italy, Hungary, and the United Kingdom have convened over the last week in celebration of a historic marriage that, in many ways, has shaken the historical European royal institution to its very core. A marriage between Wilhelm IV, the lead issue of the House of Hohenzollern, and Archduchess Rosa von Österreich, one of the the foremost duchesses of the House of Habsburg, were wed in Lucerne, Switzerland over the weekend. While both houses forbid, unofficially or officially, the marraige of legitimate offspring to unlanded suitors, this marriage occurred at the behest of both houses. While both spouses are de jure titled, neither's ancestral house holds sway in the homelands of their births. What this could represent if that were reversed, however, is monumental..."

swi.100.d: "The 1939 Federal Elections are upon us! This year, it is split between the incumbent FDP-CDVP coalition, the rallying SDPS, and the minority SUP. Behind them are a spattering of ethnic nationalist parties and socialist-communists, though none of these parties are expected to get more than a couple seats each. The FDP, which has led the council in seats for the past three elections, may be challenged yet. The current council, which seats 4 members of the FDP, 2 members of the CDVP, and one member of the SDPS, has not changed since 1919, but this could easily change in the coming weeks..."
swi.101.d: "The ballots are coming in, and most cantons have reported; this election sees the outcome of..."
swi.102.d: "The SDPS, whose numbers of seats changed drastically in the previous election, are demanding another seat in the council! While they already control one, they seem truly desiring of another... It is unsure as of yet who they will elect, but it is sure to be someone contentious, even within their own party..."
swi.103.d: "The SUP, who finally held a significant share of the vote and represented themselves as an alternative to the FDP's unchained liberalism and the SDPS's all-encompassing socialism, are demanding a seat on the council. Judging by their new political position in the Swiss political sphere, it seems necessary that the other parties oblige..."
swi.104.d: "The Coucil Membership, once worried to be entering a state of flux, did not receive any drastic changes in the recent election. While the FDP and CDVP gained a couple seats, no party is expected to get voted into the council. For all intents and purposes, the Council has reached status quo for the fourth consecutive election."
swi.106.d: "Rudolf Minger, the leader of the Christlichdemokratische Volkspartei, gave an interview in the press yesterday of his ambition to restore Switzerland to its 'agrarian roots'. This supposed arrangement goes against the FDP-CDVP coalition line that claims to service all citizens of Switzerland, from the farms to the urban centers and other developed regions. The move, to say the least, was considered very politically unshrewd."
swi.107.d: "The FDP's vote in the Council, which attempted to ameliorate hostilities with socialist factions in Switzerland through negotiation, met yesterday. Talks are ongoing, but warmer than expected..."
swi.108.d: "Polls within the Federal Council and National Council indicate that a shift toward the CDVP's politics has become apparent. Several members of the FDP have stepped down from political positions following the violent response to the strikes and wider socialist movement within Switzerland. While several conservative members are attempting to stop a possible path towards tyranny, several radical members of the CDVP are attempting to make themselves known, and make themselves heard."
swi.109.d: "Negotiations with the socialist striker groups has paid off! Although we had to make some concessions, we avoided a widescale catastrophe like 1935. The strikers are generally back to work, and the workplaces that were once shut down for days are running again."
swi.110.d: "The CDVP has lodged a threat to usurp the coalition in the National Council! From this point on, the coalition in its current form can be considered dissolved, and talks are already underway between the SDPS and the FDP, but after the recent strikes, most political commentators are saying that that is far from the possible. At this moment, the CDVP seems to control the political landscape of Switzerland."
swi.111.d: "Jean Debet, a political newcomer from the Geneva canton, gave an impassioned speech to the National Council today denouncing the capitulation of the Freisinnig-Demokratische Partei to the socialist protestors. Himself considered a radical amongst fellow party members, he was swiftly denounced by other fellow moderates. The coalition holds, at least for now."
swi.112.d: "Albert Meyer, leader of the FDP, tendered his resignation today from Swiss politics. Considered a tentpole and mainstay of the party for the past decade, his resignation came as combined shock and expectation, depending on one's political outlook. Another blow to a party staggering from a dangerous strike."
swi.113.d: "In an announcement issued today from FDP headquarters in Bern, most remaining FDP National Council members have agreed to form a coalition with the CDVP, with their party as the minority representatives. For all intents and purposed, the old coalition still stands, though radically altered nonetheless."
swi.114.d: ""
swi.115.d: "Several socialist groups, notably those from the radical sects of the SDPS and the Arbeiter-sozialisten-liga, have arranged large scale strikes and protests across the nation! It is undeniable a negative response to the recent status quo election. In many ways, it mirrors the strikes of 1935, and some from our coalition are not so amenable to negotiations this time around..."
swi.116.d: "The CDVP has won the deliberation vote in the Council on a response to the union strikes after convincing FDP member Johannes Baumann. The result is a harsh sentence for violent strikers- now in the press the FDP, which only a couple years ago was considered to be politically cooperative with the CDVP is reconsidering such a position."
swi.117.d: "Yesterday, Robert Tobler, one of the leading figures of the CDVP, was elected to the Federal Council, and has today been elected as President of Switzerland. While the position doesn't itself carry many additional privileges, it was used as a pretext by Tobler to dissolve the oligarchic nature of the cabinet. The CDVP-FDP coalition in the National Council agreed to the conditions to the immense disagreement of the SDPS, the SUP, and surprisingly every ethnic nationalist party holding seats in the National Council. Regardless, in a move Tobler declared to be a 'striking blow to socialist terrorists from Geneva to Bregenz', the Federal Council now acts more like a cabinet than an organ of state, and all duties have essentially been handed to those of his choosing, though the member of the SDPS has kept his position, at least for now."
swi.420.d: "In the light of recent failure to keep the enemies from our borders, refugees have been departing from [root.GetName] in droves. Their exact desinations remain to be seen, no less the fact that they will struggle to get there with enemy blockades patrolling the waters. It is already being reported that Switzerland is more than glad to take in refugees..."
