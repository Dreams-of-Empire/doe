### Events
newamerica.1.t: "Cementing Our Authority"
newamerica.1.d: "The New American Republic is a young republic brought upon the destruction of the old and corrupt United States. The governors have been discontented with the policies of the Federal Government and have outright seceeded from the union and have formed the New American Republic. While some of our citizens our respecting our authority; some do not, specially those who are in the lower classes and the minorities. They see as a mere puppet of the Corpoate Council; and not a legitimate government like those in Washington. Many have been proposing that we conduct some sort of a relations with the minorities and the working classes, however, there are also some, that don't want a compromise with them; as we have the troops that can pacify future threats if necessary."
newamerica.1.a: "Our authority comes from the guns of the army"

newamerica.2.t: "Compromise with Simmons?"
newamerica.2.d: "William Joseph Simmons, the leader for the APP, or the American Purity Party, with its paramilitary wing, the Black Legion.

newamerica.2.a: "As long as it will solidify our power"
newamerica.2.b: "They give me the creeps, but do nothing"
newamerica.2.c: "Ban them outright"
newamerica.3.t: "Reviewing the Unemployment Benefits"
newamerica.3.d: "In hopes of alleviating some of the effects of the economic recession, there have been the proposal of reviewing the unemployment benefits that can be used as funds in case of it being revoked. However, revoking these benefits can surely make our administration popular, and thus, some within the government have the idea of only revoking the benfits of those who are classified as minorities which can free up some funding at the same time, avoiding being unpopular onto our citizens."
newamerica.3.a: "Revoke for the minorities"
newamerica.3.b: "Revoke it for all"
newamerica.4.t: "Garrisons in Detriot?"
newamerica.4.d: "On the meeting with [Root.GetLeader], General Moseley have proposed to deploy garrisons throughout the city of Detriot; in order to secure the heart of the Republic and also to lessen the henious activities commited by the criminals. While the proposal of General Moseley have been quite sensible to say the least; we can also deploy those garrisons on other parts of the nation; effectively securing our control outside of the urban areas."
newamerica.4.a: "Deploy the garrisons"
newamerica.4.b: "They are more needed elsewhere"
newamerica.5.t: "The Minimum Wage Issue"
newamerica.5.d: "The idea of an standardized minimum wage has not been quite in the government's concerns recently. However, unions and labour leaders have been quite vocal about it since, and they have gained the momentum recently; as officials in the government have proposed a minimum wage for the workers throughout the nation. The resolution is already in the legislative body of the government and is being reviewed."
newamerica.5.a: "What an absurd demand"
newamerica.5.b: "It is only for the privileged ones"
newamerica.5.c: "Just accept it, it's only money"
newamerica.6.t: "Recruitments in the Black Legion"
newamerica.6.d: "There have been intelligence reports from our security forces that the Black Legion, the paramilitary wing of the APP have been conducting recruitment campaigns all over Detriot and its surronding areas. Current members of the legion will kidnap potential members to force their entry onto the organization. These activities by the APP has been a worrysome for many; and there are officers in the security forces that demands their arrest; however, many within the civilian government wishes to leave them alone."
newamerica.6.a: "Leave them alone"
newamerica.6.b: "Order their arrests"
newamerica.7.t: "Clash at Chicago"
newamerica.7.d: "In response to the recent policies of the government in various aspects of life throughout the republic; many dissatisfied groups have gathered around the city of Chicago organizing a protest in hopes of reversing some, if not all of the controversial politicies.\n\nThe deployed security forces however, were eager to disperse the protesters, that resulted in a heated conversation that ultimately ended in a clash between the protesting minorities and our security forces."
newamerica.7.a: "Oh no..."
newamerica.8.t: "Tragedy at Western Avenue"
newamerica.8.d: "During the clash between our security forces and the minorities who are protesting our decision to further limit their activities; a teenage girl with a non-white ancestry was accidentaly shot by our forces, who then died from the injury. Reports have claimed that our forces have mistakenly relate the teenage girl from the protesters who are en route to run some errands. "
newamerica.8.a: "We send our condolences"
newamerica.9.t: "The Investigation"
newamerica.9.d: "The controversial death of a teenage girl during the clash at the city of Chicago have amplified the voices of those who wanted the government to conduct investigations on those who are responsible for the tragedy that have happened during the clash.\n\nWe ourselves, controls what will be the outcome of this investigation; while we can blame everything that has happened on the protesters, we can also blame the unfortunate event on some of our officers; however no matter what our decision will be; the consequences are inevitable."
newamerica.9.a: "The protesters are at fault"
newamerica.9.b: "The officers are at fault"
newamerica.10.t: "The March at Detriot"
newamerica.10.d: "With the growing popularity of the American Purity Party, headed by William J. Simmons; paramilitary forces and military units sympathetic to the cause have marched onto the capital, securing important government facilities and installations. The whereabouts of [Root.GetLeader] is still unknown; but it doesn't matter, as the APP have taken control of the apparatus of state; installing Simmons as the new President of the New American Republic."
newamerica.10.a: "A new era for America!"
newamerica.11.t: "In the Name of Stability"
newamerica.11.d: "The controversial policies of the Ford administration have left the military to seize control of themselves, in the name of securing the stability of the state. Important government installations and facilities have been secured by military units and General Moseley have been installed as temporary President of the New American Republic."
newamerica.11.a: "A new era for America!"
newamerica.12.t: "Ford Secures Corporate Backing"
newamerica.12.d: "In response to his more hardline reforms throughout the New Republic, [Root.GetLeader] was voted out of office by the Corporate Council. It seems that the council has lost confidence on Teagle's leadership and has installed the famed Henry Ford as the new President."
newamerica.12.a: "Good luck, Mr. Ford!"
newamerica.13.t: "Workers Join the Protesters"
newamerica.13.d: "In supporting their fellow oppressed \"comrades\" the workers in various locations in the state have joined the minorities in their protests.Union leaders and prominent activists have organized a worker strike that have effectively paralyzed our economy.\n\nThere are some in the government, specially in the security forces that proposes to arrest the organisers of the strikes. However this action can even escelate the tension and might make things worse; there are also those who proposes to ignore the current situation mainly believing that it will resolve onto itself. However, whatever we might do, there will be consequences."
newamerica.13.a: "Order the arrest of their leaders!"
newamerica.13.b: "Ignore them and carry on"
newamerica.14.t: "Revolt!"
newamerica.14.d: "On this day, early in the morning, an unthinkable has happened, the protesters and rioters have overpowered our security forces in the city of Chicago and have seized control of important government offices and buildings.

newamerica.15.t: "Victory in Chicago"
newamerica.15.d: "Our forces were once again marching in the city of Chicago, before it is seized by the anarchist trying to declare an independent state of their own.\n\nHowever, due to our military might and industrial capabilities, we have defeated them and made sure that their ideas are with them on their graves."

newamerica.16.t: "The Air Force Doctrine"
newamerica.16.d: "The newly created New American Air Force has been debating on what doctrine should the institution will focus on, there are voices that persue the supporting role of the air force for the army, in chance of giving our troops the better edge in combat; however, there are also voices that advocates in focusing on destruction of enemy industry and infrastructure, to halt their war machine."
newamerica.16.a: "They need support the army on the field"
newamerica.16.b: "They need to unleash fire onto the enemy territory"
newamerica.17.t: "The Second Great Migration"
newamerica.17.d: "As we have attempted to force the minorities to stay in our territories; there have been reports of a overwhelming number of Black Americans, Asians and Native Americans fleeing into the south and east, territories controlled by the old federal Government and the newly established state of New England."
newamerica.17.a: "Interesting..."
newamerica.18.t: "Refugees from [NAR.GetNameDef]"
newamerica.18.d: "Despite the attempts of [NAR.GetNameDef] to force its minorities to stay in their territory, an increasingly large number of black Americans are ironically fleeing to the South and East. The total is likely numbering in at least a million, with many seeking to settle in our territory due to its obvious proximity. In particular, the urban regions of New Orleans are seeing an inflow of migrants. White populists such as Virgil Effinger suggest also stopping anymore blacks from entering so as to not threaten the white working class. However, much of the Republicans and Progressives disagree with this and alongside our generals see an opportunity for recruitment and potential factory workers. They recommend allowing the migrants to settle and recruiting them at once."
newamerica.18.a: "Let them in"
newamerica.18.b: "Announce we won't be taking in anymore"
newamerica.19.t: "Archbishops seek support"
newamerica.19.d: "Perceving [Root.GetLeader] as a useful ally against both the Klan and socialists, many archbishops are coming around to the new policies after previously being hostile to Charles Coughlin's influence among the Catholic population, with the most notable being Archbishop Edward Aloysius Mooney whom is now openly embracing to the new regime. Privately, the Archbishop desires increased funding for Catholic diocoses, for [Root.GetLeader] to endorse friendship with Catholic nations and for it to be easier to Catholic immigrants to become naturalized immigrants. However, some in the government do not desire any such agreement, thinking [Root.GetLeader] should do it without their approval since they view the clericy with suspicion for not endorsing them sooner. However, the Archbishops promise increased support for the regime if he agrees."
newamerica.19.a: "Agree"
newamerica.19.b: "No, we are beholden to Catholic supporters not the Church" 
newamerica.20.t: "The Jewish Question"
newamerica.20.d: "As all of the NDWL factions have long invariably believed, the Jewish population of America and the world is a subversive and self-interested element, uniterested in contributing to American society and linked to Bolshevism and cultural degeneracy.\nNow that we have secured our hold on power, it falls to President [Root.GetLeader] to settle the matter of our future policy towards the Jews. The moderates in our government want to revive Henry Fords's plans of Jewish segregation, ensuring that Jews across America are placed in their own self-contained communities within designated cities.\nWithin the hardliner opposition to this, there are many nativists who would like to see Jews repatriated from America, across the Canadian border and on to destinations of their choosing far from our pleasant land. Meanwhile, there are those who believe that Yockey should not underestimate the lucrative possibility of cheap Jewish labor."
newamerica.20.a: "Extend Jim Crow to the Jews"
newamerica.20.b: "Repatriate them en masse"
newamerica.20.c: "They will redeem themselves through labour"
newamerica.21.t: "Fighting Crime"
newamerica.22.d: "Security Minister Thompson has announced a new struggle against "the criminal population" of America and those who have reasonable suspicion to commit crimes in the future due to "ancestral ties to crime and degeneracy". Following these announcements, there was a significant increase in policing budgets, particularly for police and national guard stations in the Deep South and Black Belt of America. These efforts have led to a noticeable increase in the police presence in Black neighborhoods in cities and the rural parts of the South, with even national guard troops forming patrols in areas such as Tulsa, Oklahoma. With the restoration of order in mind, police departments have been increasing arrests for breaking Jim Crow laws and fining African-Americans with charges of "causing a commotion at late times" even for those simply walking out past 5 P.M. Even the death penalty has been increasingly used in state’s prisons against prisoners who have already been imprisoned for years before the new crime fighting bills."
newamerica.22.a: "Finally, the White man can sleep peacefully!"
newamerica.23.t: "Black Education Act"
newamerica.23.d: "The wave of public education changes implemented by Simmons in order to solidify Christian Identity into the youth of America is nearly complete. His final act, which passed with unanimous approval by the delegates, is the Black Education Act. The Black Education Act totally redefines education practices for ethnic minority communities and, in particular, African-Americans. Notably it makes it illegal to teach education to African-Americans divorced from their role as laborers, distances them from older notions of religious unity across races and slashes already minor public spending on Black Schools. As part of his speech announcing the law, Simmons stated, 'There is no place for the Negro in the Anglo Saxon community above the level of laborer. What is the use of teaching the Negro child mathematics, when it cannot use it in practice?'."
newamerica.23.a: "It's for the best"
newamerica.24.t: "The Pass Laws"
newamerica.24.d: "The new government has begun issuing a passbook to African-Americans throughout the Commonwealth in anticipation of the Pass Laws taking effect next year. This law is similar to older internal passport used during the time of the Confederacy to identify freemen and slaves. This has resulted in numerous African-Americans being forbidden from traveling outside of the south with plans to extend zoning into the rest of the Republic in order to intensify segregation, a policy in-line with [Root.GetLeader]'s fervent opposition to race-mixing in most forms."
newamerica.24.a: "Papers Please."
newamerica.25.t: "The Third Great Migration"
newamerica.25.d: "Those thousands of African-Americans that left America before the civil war are being joined by hundreds of thousands more fleeing White Leaguer terror. Groups like the International Labor Defense and the NAACP are now working together with the Red Cross to evacuate masses of people struggling to remain free. To the White Defense Leagues and their leaders, this plays into a long-standing fear of a united front against their rule. At the same time, the fewer the dissidents internally, the safer loyalists can sleep."
newamerica.25.a: "America is expelling toxins."
newamerica.26.t: "American Refugees Arrive"
newamerica.26.d.can: "A vast number of Americans, many of them African-Americans have fled across here in the North fleeing Simmon's men. We have officially welcomed them as Canadians and many of them want to settle in our country."
newamerica.26.d.usa: "A vast number of Americans, many of them African-Americans have fled into the south fleeing Simmons's goons. We have officially welcomed them as true Americans and more then a few are ready and willing to fight against Simmons."
newamerica.26.d.nee: "A vast number of Americans, many of them African-Americans have fled into New England fleeing Simmons's goons. We have officially welcomed them as true Americans and more then a few are ready and willing to fight against Simmons."
newamerica.26.d.lib: "The thousands that arrived with Marcus Garvey in the early 1930s anticipated that more refugees would come. Even the strongest pessimist could not anticipate the overflow of refugees the Black Star Line has picked up and dropped off in Monrovia. Families are reunited, and the Grain Coast now swells with thousands more Americo Liberians. Those more concerned with food production however have noted that we can't really handle a growing population at this time."
newamerica.26.d.mex: "The existence of American refugees in Mexico has generally been ignored by the Central Government, as we have had amicable relations with America in the past. However, this Simmons is a threat to the entire continent, and the thousands more refugees crossing the Rio Grande tell of the Silver Legion's horrors. These refugees are far different from the Ambrose Bierce's' looking to retire, they are scarred and determined to end the Legionary regime of America."
newamerica.26.d.cub: "Just a 300 mile boat trip separated the thousands of American refugees from Cuba. Families in Cuba have been calling for months to their families to escape the very real threat of a nationalist takeover. None of them anticipated that the bottleneck in Florida would be opened all at once, causing hundreds of boats to show up at Varadero today. The flood of refugees from America has clogged up our ports, tied up or landlines, and put strain on the government ministry to respond. What should be our answer?"
newamerica.26.d.hai: "Haiti has always portrayed themselves as the second home for African-Americans. A common story to tell was that the first Haitian was a refugee of Ethiopia that ran with such force that he only stopped when he fell into Haiti. Now we see this again coming out of the USA. The sinister Simmons should not have the right to do this to American people! We feel the refugees outrage, at the same time we struggle to determine whether our fragile economy can handle a labor surplus of this magnitude."
newamerica.26.a: "You are welcome to stay"
newamerica.27.t: "The \"Other Minories\""
newamerica.27.d: "A session between the senior members of the APP or the American Purity Party have discussed a couple of new policies that may change the lives other undeemed non-white citizens such as the remaining Indians and with Asian-descent. In the case of native Americans; some within the party have proposed to seize their properties and relocate them in some sort of villages away from the urban districts of the country.\n\nWhile in the case of the people with Asian ethnicity, some proposed to deport them back to Asia; such as China and Japan where they can be do no more damage in the American society. However, there are other radical members within the party that advocates that people with native Indian and Asian decent should be contained within a labour camp; where they can work for the state in exchange for some basic goods."
newamerica.27.a: "We'll proceed with the more moderate approach."
newamerica.27.b: "Free labour is good right?"
newamerica.28.t: "The APP Question"
newamerica.28.d: "The American Purity Party is a white-supremacist organization that advocates for the purification of the American state; expelling the deemed undesirables from the cities and lands of America. While they are not hostile to our own government, this can not mean that they cannot be a threat to our power in the near future. They are recruiting for their own paramilitary organization; in hopes of eliminating their undeemed undesirables. The government has conveyed to this question; and have decided to..."
newamerica.28.a: "...ban then and arrest their leaders"
newamerica.28.b: "...let them be"

newamerica.100.t: "[BPS.GetName] Entry to the Accord"
newamerica.100.d: "The [NAR.GetAdjective] Government have approached us today, proposing a formal alliance between our two nations; in hopes of crushing the collectivist threat in the region, after all, we are in a strategic advanNAR_rust_belte in defeating the marxists."

newamerica.104.d: "The [From.GetAdjective] Government have refused our offer of our formal alliance with them. We may have to look elsewhere."
newamerica.104.a: "A tragedy to be sure, otherwise an opportunity..."
newamerica.105.t: "Supporting a Side"
newamerica.105.d: "Ever since the collapse of the Qing dynasty, China have been quite under chaos and anarchy. There are multiple competing governments that claims the legitimate government of the Chinese nation.\n\nThere is the so called, \"Democratic\" forces under the Kuomintang, founded by Sun Yat Sen and currently lead by [CHI.GetLeader]; then there is the Beiyang Government that have defeated the Kuomintang in their \"Northern Expedition\" but have lost to the Fengtian Government in Manchuria currently lead by [MAN.GetLeader]."

newamerica.106.a: "Great!"
newamerica.107.t: "Washington Requests [PHI.GetAdjective] Entry to the [FRA.GetFaction]"
newamerica.107.d: "The delegates from Washington are requesting that we also invite the [PHI.GetAdjective] Government in the [Root.GetFaction]. This may can be an advanNAR_rust_belte as the location of [PHI.GetNameDef] is strategically viable."
newamerica.107.a: "Send out the invite"

newamerica.108.t: "[FRA.GetName] Invites us to [FRA.GetFaction]"

newamerica.111.d: "The [FRA.GetAdjective] Government have outright refused our demand in inviting [PHI.GetNameDef] into the alliance. It is not the end of the world however, as we can leave the alliance in retaliation or just accept their decision and leave [PHI.GetNameDef] behind."

newamerica.112.t: "Washington Threatens to Leave"
newamerica.112.d: "The [From.GetAdjective] Government, have shown their arrogance and have threathened us to leave the alliance. If the [From.GetAdjective] leave the alliance, they may be our future enemy; but we will cave in into their demands; we may be dragged onto a pointless war."
