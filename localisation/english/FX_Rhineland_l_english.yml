###Pre Crisis Stuff###
rhi.0.d: "|NOTE| The Rhine is heavily WIP and is missing content early on, along with content past late 1938, so play at your own risk!\n\nThe History of the Rhenish state begins not with its formation, but with the Great War. The Rhine was a stronghold of the German economy, lush with people, coal, iron, and come 1919, blood. The Entente pushed the German army to the east bank of the Rhine in the 1919 offensive, and the industrial base of Germany was put under allied occupation. When the Germans surrendered soon after, the allies remained in the Rhine, ensuring that German reparations would be paid through the direct control of Germany’s coal and iron. The United States, Italy, France, and the United Kingdom formed the Inter-Allied Rhineland High Commission to “Ensure, by any means, the security and satisfaction of all the needs of the Armies of Occupation”. The Rhenish occupation was in truth anything but an Inter-Allied operation, with the United States post war isolation and the withdrawal of all allied forces but those of France. \n\nThe occupation force found that it would be no easy task to control the wealth of the Rhine as the Spartacist Revolution of 1919 led to thousands of Rhenish insurgents attempting to take control of the region. The French army, with support of the Freikorps, managed to put down the revolt and crush the communist presence in the region. The following decade found the Rhine in a state of uneasy peace, with French police cracking down on revolutionaries and rebels and sporadic strikes. \n\nThis all changed suddenly with Dresslers coup. The Rhenish powder keg was lit aflame once more. Hans Adam Dorten, a Freikorps and WW1 veteran, reformed a Freikorps militia with the aid of the popular Rhenish nationalist Josef Friedreich Matthes, declared in the Wiesbaden Proclamation the formation of “The Independent Rhenish Republic” and began Mainz Putsche. The Rhenish militia soon found their numbers to be in the hundreds instead of thousands, having vastly overestimated their own popularity. The French occupant General Charles Mangin refused to wipe out the insurgents with his force, instead proposing to High Commissioner Paul Tirard that they may use the insurgents against the rebelling Valkist and resurgent communist forces. The following Leipzig Declaration was issued, stating that “The formation of a Rhenish state shall occur upon the stabilization of the Rhine”, while Dorten and Matthes were often amnesty in exchange for using the Freikorps to crush the rebellions throughout the Rhine. Dorten and Matthes agreed, and soon a revitalized Freikorps with Rhenish aid defeated the Ruhr Rebellion. It is also notable that during the chaos of 1932, the Mayor of Köln, Konrad Adenauer, made a name for himself for his support of the French occupation, famously saying that it was “the rare case in which the conquered is satisfied with the conquerer”, speaking of how the French occupation has protected them from the Valkists.\n\nThe fires of 1932 were stomped out, but the embers of the Rhine may yet again set the powderkeg aflame."
rhi.1.d: "The Rhine is full of a diverse array of political parties and figures, six of which have sway over the population.\n\nFree Arbeiter Union Rheinlands (FAUR)\nLed by the socialist Rudolf Rocker, the Free Worker’s Union of the Rhineland is the only remaining radical socialist organization in the Rhine. Composed of trade unionists and the few remnants of the Spartacists, the FAUR has lost any real power in the Rhine under the weight of the Freikorps watchful eye. \n\nSozialdemokratische Partei Rheinlands (SDPR)\nLed by Josef Friedreich Matthes, the SPR forms one of the largest parties seeking independence. Promised a sovereign state by the French in 1933, the party has been tolerated as Matthes is willing to cooperate with local authorities, at least for now.\n\nReinische Zentrumspartei\nLed by Konrad Adenauer, the mayor of Köln, the Zentrum are the most willing to cooperate with French authorities, and actively seek autonomy instead of independence.\n\nRheinische Volkspartei (RVP)\nLed by Hans Adam Dorten, the Volkspartei seeks the complete independence of the Rhine from foreign control. The most uncontrollable of the tolerated political parties, the Volkspartei is allowed due to the use of its military wing, the Rhenische Freikorps, in suppressing left wing dissent. The size and power of the Freikorps is worrying to many, but for now they are loyal.\n\nDeutsche Vaterlandspartei (DVP)\nLed by Victor Lutze and Albert Leo Schlageter, the DVP acts as the illegal Valkist party for German Unification. Lutze, a high ranking TST member, administers the organization from Germany while Schlageter runs the covert arm within the Rhine. Schlageter's TST-Vorhut forces act to undermine French authority while courting local aid. Schlageter first rose to prominance when he successfully commited a string of bomb attacks against French forces during the initial occupation of the Rhineland. Narrowly avoiding capture a multitude of times, Schlageter has continued to lead the Valkist resistance from the frontlines and serves as a source of both inspiration and terror throughout the Rhine.\n\nFinally, the Rhine itself is ruled by the Inter-Allied Rhineland High Commission. Originally controlled jointly by the United States, France, Britain, and Italy, the withdrawl of American and Italian commissioners has turned it into a Franco-British project. It is controlled through local collaborationists, the French military, and Franco-British funding. The occupation once benefited both France and Britian as a means of seeking reperations, but the administrative cost has exceeded its value for Great Britian while still providing France valuable coal exports. Paul Tirard, the High Commissioner, is a mild mannered man who relies heavily upon the local cooperation of the SDPR and Freikorps to maintain control. Behind him is the aging Charles Mangin, nicknamed the Butcher, who may provide a more firm hand if the situation escalates."
rhi.2.d: "The beginning of the new year comes with the drafting of a new budget. The Inter-Allied High Commission receives the majority of its funds directly from the French government, with the rest coming from inefficient taxation within the Rhine itself. E.F. Schumacher, the economic adviser to Paul Tirard, has pushed quite heavily for an infrastructure spending packet. While this will certainly enable the Rhenish economy by strengthening the rail lines and road networks, our budget is already quite tight, so others in the government, including the popular German advisor Karl von Starck, have suggested that funding be saved for unexpected costs that may arise throughout the year. "
rhi.3.d: "May Day, as expected, has resulted in protests throughout the Rhine from the leftists and unionists. Organized by the FAUR and tacitly supported by the Sozialdemokratische partei, this years protests have led to widespread rioting. The freikorps remains at our disposal, and would certainly be the easiest way to control the leftist rabble. Many within the government have begun to worry that the freikorps are growing far too powerful, however, and we could simply allow the police to deal with the riots, even if they are undermanned. Finally, we could recognize the protests as legitimate as a show of goodwill, only arresting violent protesters, but, doing so may further embolden the leftist radicals. "
rhi.4.d: "The [RHI.GetName] has recently begun a crackdown on intellectual descent. This has caused various prominant intellectuals to flee the Rhine, notably with Einstein leaving for the Jewish Commonwealth."
rhi.5.d: "Hans Adam Dorten, the nationalist leader of the Rheinische Volkspartei, has published his two part political manifesto in both French and German. The first part is titled, \"La Tragédie Rhénane\" in French, and \"Die Rheinische Tragödie\" in German. The book details the history of the struggle for Rhenish independence from Dorten’s story, beginning with his valiant service in the German army, to his disobedience to the tyrannical Kaiser, to the chaotic foundation of the Rhenish independence movement during the Ruhr Occupation. The reformation of the Rhenish Freikorps under Dorten and Otto Lichtschlag has been romanticised, displaying them as the last hope for a Rhine free from both communist, French, and valkist influence.\n\nThe second part of Dorten’s manifesto is titled, \"Génie du Rhin\" in French, or \"Genie des Rheins\" in German, and outlines Dorton’s goal for a free Rhine. According to Dorton, the Swiss were the first \"Germanic Free State\", achieving their independence from the Holy Roman Empire through the 30 years war, and expanding to incorporate both Germanic and Francophone populations. Dorton then outlines the Rhine as the \"Second Free State\". Just as the Swiss broke free from the Holy Roman Empire, the Rhine broke free from the German yoke, and now must free expand into the Francophone lands of Luxemburg and Bastogne. This give the Rhine natural borders and defences, just as the Swiss have the Alps, the Rhenish Republic must have the Meuse and Rhine rivers to defend itself. Dorten finally calls for an autarkist economy, insulated from foreign affairs, and a strong military service to protect Rhenish neutrality.\n\nDorten’s manifesto has been well received by many in the Rhine, hoping for independence at long last, but has been criticized by historians and opponents as historically simplistic and self serving. Regardless of critique, membership in the Freikorps is at an all time high, and the novel has marked the transition of Dorten’s Rheinische Volkspartei from a generally cooperative party to one of open resistance to French rule."
###Rhine Crisis###
rhi.10.d: "The market crash has set the political powderkeg of the Rhine aflame! The British have withdrawn from the Rhine, leaving the Inter-Allied High Commission under the sole perview of France. The end of British funding has caused a massive budget deficet, while the economic turmoil caused by the withdrawl of British investments has begun a catastrophic chain of events.\n\nThe combination of an emergency tax, building unrest over unequal trade agreements, economic reperations depressing the economy, and a sudden spike in unemployment has caused widespread strikes to spread throughout the Rhine, grinding the economy to a halt. Organized by the FAUR, SDPR, and RVP, resistance has taken the form of picket lines and paramilitary marches as both socialists and nationalists protest for the Rhine they desire. Clashes between FAUR strikers and Freikorps, a understaffed police force, and a sudden string of Valkist bombings have made it painfully clear that action must be taken. Tirard has begun by appealing to the French government for economic aid to releave the budget deficit and strikers alike. The fate of the Rhine lies in the balance."
rhi.11.d: "The French have shown their true colors and abandoned the Rhine to its fate. Without economic aid, the situation has continued to worsen, and calls for independence ring out. The Valkist Vaterlandspartei has grown larger as calls for unification grow and membership in the TST-Vorhut climbs. Hans Adam Dorten has declared the government illegitimate, demanding the Leipzig Declaration be honored and the Rhine allowed independence. Konrad Adenauer, the mayor of Köln, has fought against the tide of revolution and instead called for peace and autonomy from France, rather than complete seperation from French rule. Josef Friedrich Matthes, the leader of the Sozialdemokratische Partei, has simply called for Rhenish freedom without specifying who he supports. The Rhine is aflame."
rhi.12.d: "Josef Matthes has spearheaded an effort to solve the Rhenish Crisis without collapsing into civil war. He has successfully convinced Hans Adam Dorten and Konrad Adenauer to meet with local leaders to decide the fate of the Rhine once and for all in the city of Essen. The demand for a binding conference to seal the fate of the Rhine has been presented before us. Charles Mangin has argued for the acceptance of their terms in the hopes of preventing a bloody conflict favorable to the Valkists, while André François-Poncet has called for the arrest of all rebel leaders upon their arrival in Essen to squash the unrest before it can grow to a larger threat."
rhi.13.d: "Like Rome before us future historians will debate what brought on the collapse of the Rhineland. Whether it was the central governments unwillingness to compromise with opposing factions or there failiure to eliminate political dissidents, the Rhine now stands on the edge of being a failed state. Many of our citisens who onced called themsleves moderates now flock to the Vaterlandspartei who promise them stability under Germany's guidance."
rhi.14.d: "The French have allowed the conference to go forth, stating they will respect the results of the conference. Political leaders, mayors, and delegates from across the Rhine have met in Essen to debate and decide upon the fate of the Rhine. Three key camps have made themselves evident in the early days- the Volkspartei of Hans Adam Dorten is small but has garnered support amongst both the common man and military generals, while the Zentrumspartei of Konrad Adenauer appeals to many who seek peace in the Rhine. Dorten demands non-negotiable independence, while Adenauer seeks autonomy. The third party, the Sozialdemokratisches of Josef Friedrich Matthes, remain undecided as of now, making them perhaps the turning point of the debate."
rhi.15.d: "The first week of the conference has been full of heated discussion and forming factions. Matthes has long avoided commiting himself to a specific side, but he has realized he will need an ally to accomplish his goals. Matthes could appeal to the right, and ally himself with Dorten, arguing together for a strictly independent Rhine, or Matthes could appeal to Adenauer, and work for an independent Rhine under French guidance. Finally, Matthes could remain a completely neutral party to ensure he can be part of whatever government forms."
rhi.16.d: "The second week of debate continued with deadlock, but amongst it Konrad Adenauer rose to the podium to give the most powerful speech of the night, saying, "We are the rare case where the conquered is very satisfied with the conqueror." Already famous throughout the Rhine, his defence of the French occupation has made him known. He continued to speak of how the French, with all their flaws, are the only force which has allowed the Rhine to remain free of Valkist tyranny, and are the best protection an autonomous Rhine may find. The reception of this great speech however, is yet to be decided."
rhi.17.d: "The third week of the Rhenish conference has found itself locked on the issue of French economic control. Two camps have again materialized, centering on the conflict between Dorten and Korad. Dorten has proposed uncompromising nationalization of the Rhenish economy, demanding that the French cede all influence within it. Konrad, instead, wishes to gradually gain economic autonomy and invite French investors."
rhi.18.d: "The Rhine conference has ended at last! Hans Adam Dorten managed to rally the delegation to supporting his proposal. Matthes however, has been designated as the leader of the Rhine, in order to appease all camps. Dorten has still maintained a position center stage, giving a speech before the people,"It is the lost treasure of the Rhine, who commits the god of the Occident, the Latin god, to a murderous fight against the destructive forces of Asgard threatening from the darkness of the East ... The Rhenish people, the people of Siegfried, borne by Latin tradition and Christian mission, seeks to save the peace of God threatened by the East." The speech, a reference to the old norse saga of Siegfried the Burgundian slayer of dragons, states in no uncertain terms Dorten's disdain for Valkism."
rhi.19.d: "The Rhenish conference has decided to back Konrad Adenauer's plan for cooperation and autonomy under French protection. Dorten, clearly angered by this, said in a simple statement, “I do not damn the man, but to hell with his ideas!” before heading off. Dorten has decided to respect the conference and support the decision with his Freikorps, resulting in a sigh of relief from those worried of civil war. Talks with France about the details of the autonomy have begun, and it seems that a great friendship may be forged this day!"
rhi.20.d: "Failure! The Rhenish Assembly stalled in voting, with no proposal achieving a majority. As the conference went on and on with no end in sight, the Valkists took the opportunity to rally support around them. With the faith in the more moderate parties shattered, the TST-Vorhut have launched the Essen-Putsche, capturing the Rhenish Assembly and key locations throughout the Rhine! Violent clashes between the French Garrison, TST, and Freikorps, has resulted in anarchy on the Rhine!"
rhi.21.d: "To help aleviate the crisis currently efflicting the Rhine, France has sent monetary aid to our government to help our nation to get back on it's feet once again."
rhi.22.d: "Konrad Adenauer has proposed a Rhenish autonomy to help secure the Rhine in this crisis. This idea, popular with Paul Tirard and the government as the situation in the Rhine becomes increasily desperate, would still need to be allowed by the French Government who rule over us.."
rhi.23.d: "The French agree with Adenauer's plan and support granting our state more autonomy over our internal affairs."
rhi.24.d: "Failiure to find a solution to the Rhenish political crisis has emboldened the Valkists to take up arms and resist against our weak state. Adenauer has bypassed us and appealed to the French directly with his proposal! The fate of the Rhine has fallen entirely from our hands."
rhi.31.d: "The Rhenish government's failiure to maintain peace within it's borders has forced France to establish a mandate over our nation. For the foreseable future France will have direct control over the politics and administration of the Rhine."
rhi.32.d: "To many a French Rhine was always doomed to fail. The Rhine is German and has always been German. No more will we be the lesser partner to a foreign power. Germany is our future."
rhi.33.d: "Talks with France have resulted in an agreement- An autonomous Rhenish Republic shall be formed underneath the leadership of Konrad Adenauer. Tirard and Adenauer signed the documents symbolically, and, upon the creation of the Rhenish Republic, President Adenauer's first order of business was the appointment of Josef Friedrich Matthes as his chancellor. While they have their differences, the coalition government has enabled the Rhine to have broad popular support. The Rhenish National Assembly’s first order of business was to sign an agreement of perpetual alliance to France. While this was met with general positivity, many in the newly formed assembly were quick to point out that France required the continuation of coal shipments and an unequal trade agreement. Nevertheless, the Rhine has come far from what it once was."
rhi.34.d: "After deliberation, the Rhenish Conference has decided upon the framework of the Rhenish Confederation (Rheinisch Bund). Based heavily upon the Weimar Republic, the government largely mirrors it. As a federal republic, the government shall be lead by a strong President (Bundespräsident) and a limited Chancellor (Bundeskanzler). Finally, the Rhenish National Assembly (Rheinisch Nationalversammlung) will form the legislative body of government. The largest differences between the Rhenish government and the Weimar is the establishment of a strong independent judiciary; the Rhenish National Court (Rheinisches Landesgericht). \n\nThe National Convention has decided that the first elections shall occur in January of 1938 and repeat every four years after that to help ensure presidential accountability. Until then, the provisional government has been formed with Josef Friedrich Matthes as the acting President, and the outspoken nationalist Hans Adam Dorten as the chancellor, with members of the constitutional delegation forming the National Assembly."
rhi.35.d: "While the coalition government of Matthes of Dorten was originally created to have a stable Rhine, the ideological differences between Dorten and Matthes have grown too large to ignore. Matthes promotes a pacifistic social democratic state in cooperation with France, while Dorten has pushed heavily for nationalization of resources and the expansion of the Rhine."
rhi.36.d: "The Rhine has long had the Koblence as the provisonal center of government, but with the new regime of the [RHI.GetName] comes the opportunity to shift the center of power."
rhi.50.d: "The Rhineland has brought France and Germany into conflict countless times over the centuries. The industrial revolution has made the Rhine one of the most productive abd valuable regions in the world. Those who control the Rhine control Europe so when the French occupied the valley following the Great War it was of no surprise that this would spark revanchism in the German people. German Fuhrer Adam Dressler now demands that a referendum takes place within our nation to determine the status of the Rhineland. Though our nation has generally been divided down the middle between pro-French and pro-German positions, economic and political instability has pushed more and more of our citisens to support German rule. We must be cautious with how we proceed."

We must be cautious with how we proceed."
rhi.53.d: "To appease Germany we have decided to go through with a Referendum. The vote will be a simple choice between two options. Either to maintain the status quo or unify with Germany. Despite some worries of the unification vote winning most experts agree such a scenario is unlikly."
rhi.101.d: "The London Stock Market Crash has sent a shockwave across the globe. In Rhineland, our buffer between us and Germany, the economic disaster has crippled the nation's ability to effectively manage it's internal affairs. We may have to intervene and help the Rhine restablish itself but many ministers are argue that France is in no position to economically support itself, let alone another nation."
rhi.102.d: "The political situation in the Rhinland has completly broken down. A thorough solution will need to to be found to help alleviate this situation. Though some ministers wish to compromise with the Rhine and find a diplomatic solution it may be time to send in French troops to restore order."
rhi.103.d: "Any semblance of control in the Rhineland has collapsed. The nation is on verge of a full blown civil war and without immediate support the national government in Koblence is doomed to collapse. While our army is ready to intervene if we give the word many ministers in Paris debate the value of contined support of such and innefective government."
rhi.104.d: "Konrad Adenauer has approached our government with a plan to help alleviate the crisis in the Rhineland. In his plan the Rhenish government in Koblence would be given more authority over it's internal affairs, allowing it to directly deal with Rhenish issues and efficently as possible. While his plan isn't perfect it's very popular with the Rhenish people."
rhi.105.d: "The political situation in the Rhine has collapsed. People are demanding major reforms for there nation. While this may help the situation in the short term it would also lessen our influence over the Rhineland."
rhi.106.d: "The French occupation of the Rhine has destroyed relations between Germany and France ever since the end of the Great War and the eventual French expansion into the Ruhr in 20's helped bring the once fringe Valkistische Deutsche Volkspartei into prominance. Revanchism has hit a boiling point in Germany now. German Chancellor Adam Dressler now demands that a referendum to determine    "
rhi.200.d: "Despite the shock from the international community it is of no surprise that the Rhineland Referendum ended in a majority vote for German unification. The Rhine is German and has always been. The path towards a united Greater Germany marches ever closer."
rhi.201.d: "In a shocking turn of events the brainwashed Rhenish people have voted to maintain the status quo of there nation. It is obvious to most that this referendum was fraudulent and can not be taken as any way legitimate. If reunification can't be achieved peacefully we may have to take it by force."
rhi.202.d: "Despite being a corner stone of the French nation, the politicians in Paris and Koblence have refused to listen to the voice of there people.

RHI_anti_tank_equipment_1_desc: "The Pak 36 (Panzerabwehrkanone 36) is a 3.7 cm caliber German anti-tank gun. Developed by Rheinmetall in 1933, it was first issued to the German Army in 1936, with models becoming available in the Rhine and abroad through both German influence and the Rheinmetall company. While capable of piercing small armor, it is incapable of piercing heavier and more modern tanks."
RHI_anti_tank_equipment_2: "7,5 cm PaK 40"
RHI_anti_tank_equipment_2_desc: "The 7.5 cm Pak 40 (7,5 cm Panzerabwehrkanone 40) was a German 75 millimetre anti-tank gun developed in 1939-1941 by Rheinmetall. The Pak 40 was much heavier than the Pak 38; its decreased mobility meant that it was difficult or even impossible to move without an artillery tractor on boggy ground, however its greater firepower means it was capable of piercing almost all contemporary tank models."
RHI_anti_tank_equipment_3: "12,8 cm PaK 44"
RHI_anti_tank_equipment_3_desc: "The 12.8 cm Pak 44 L/55 (Pak, (Ger.) Panzerabwehrkanone) was a heavy anti-tank gun used. Development initially concentrated on a field gun known as the Kanone K 44, however, once heavier  armour started to appear the design requirements were altered to include an anti-armour role. The Pak 44 had short to medium-range performance similar to the 8.8 cm Pak 43, but the 12.8 cm Pak 44 better maintained its anti-tank performance over long to extreme-long ranges (1800–2700+ metres) while also doubling as an effective field gun when firing HE."

RHI_anti_air_equipment_1_desc: "The Flak 30 (Flugabwehrkanone 30) is the main anti-air weapon of Germany. The original Flak 30 design was developed from the Solothurn ST-5 as a project for the Kriegsmarine, which produced the 20 mm C/30. Rheinmetall then started an adaptation of the C/30 for Army use, producing the 2 cm Flak 30. Generally similar to the C/30, the main areas of development were the mount, which was fairly compact. Set-up could be accomplished by dropping the gun to the ground off its two-wheeled carriage and levelling with hand cranks. The result was a triangular base that allowed fire in all directions."
RHI_anti_air_equipment_2: "2 cm Flakvierling 38"
RHI_anti_air_equipment_2_desc: "The Flakvierling 38 combined four Flak 38 autocannons onto a single carriage, and acts as an improve and modernized Flak 30 model. "

RHI_anti_air_equipment_3_desc: "The 8.8 cm Flak 41 is a German 88 mm anti-aircraft and anti-tank artillery gun. Flak is a contraction of German Flugzeugabwehrkanone meaning "aircraft-defense cannon", the original purpose of the weapon. The versatile carriage allowed the 8.8 cm FlaK to be fired in a limited anti-tank mode when still on its wheels; it could be completely emplaced in only two and a half minutes. Based on Krupp designs, Rheinmetall created a more powerful anti-aircraft gun, the 8.8 cm Flak 41."

RHI_artillery_equipment_1_short: "10.5 cm LeFH 18"
RHI_artillery_equipment_1_desc: "The 10.5 cm leFH 18 (German: leichte Feldhaubitze "light field howitzer") was a German light howitzer. Designed in the late 1920s, it represented a major advance on its predecessor the 10.5 cm leFH 16. It was superior in caliber to its early opponents in the war, with adequate range and firepower, but the modern split trail gun carriage that provided it with more stability and traverse also rendered it too heavy for a mobile role in the largely horse-drawn artillery battalions of the German army, particularly in the mud and snow."
RHI_artillery_equipment_2: "15 cm sFH 18"
RHI_artillery_equipment_2_desc: "The 15 cm schwere Feldhaubitze 18 or sFH 18 (German: "heavy field howitzer, model 18"), nicknamed Immergrün ("Evergreen"), was the basic German division-level heavy howitzer. Its mobility and firing range and the effectiveness of its 44 kilogram shell made it the most important weapon of all German infantry divisions. The sFH 18 was twice as heavy as its predecessor, had a muzzle velocity increase of forty percent, a maximum firing range 4.5 kilometers greater, and a new split-trail gun carriage that increased the firing traverse twelvefold. It was the first artillery weapon equipped with rocket-assisted ammunition to increase range. "
RHI_artillery_equipment_3: "Feldhaubitze 43 "
RHI_artillery_equipment_3_desc: "The designs for the leFH 43 are the result of the war experience of the Wehrmacht up to this point in time with regard to the tactical-technical requirements . Thus, in addition to a large range, shooting in the upper angle groups, ie with overshoots of over 45 degrees, was possible become. In addition, the ability to carry out the firefighting all around was required for anti-tank defense and adaptation to the increasingly mobile nature of warfare. In view of these demanding demands of course had the gun weight , its reduction still in the 10.5 -inch lightweight field howitzer 42in the first place had to be cut back."
RHI_rocket_artillery_equipment_1: "28/32 cm Nebelwerfer 41"
RHI_rocket_artillery_equipment_1_desc: "The 28/32 cm Nebelwerfer 41 (28/32 cm NbW 41) was a six-barrelled rocket launcher mounted on a two-wheeled carriage. It used two different rockets. The  Wurfkörper Spreng (Explosive missile) rocket weighed 82 kilograms and had a 50 kilograms high-explosive warhead. The  Wurfkörper Flamm (Incendiary missile) was filled with incendiary oil (Flammöl), but could carry poison gases or decontamination fluids. The oil could cover 200 square metres. Both rockets were spin-stabilized and electrically-fired. The rockets were fired one at a time, in a timed ripple, but the launcher had no capability to fire single rockets."

RHI_medium_tank_destroyer_equipment_2: "Jagdpanzer IV"
RHI_medium_tank_destroyer_equipment_2_short: "JagdPz IV"
RHI_medium_tank_destroyer_equipment_2_desc: "The Jagdpanzer IV served in the anti-tank sections of Panzer and SS Panzer divisions. They fought in Normandy, the Battle of the Bulge and on the Eastern Front. They were very successful tank destroyers but performed badly when used out of role as substitutes for tanks or assault guns, as most tank destroyers were. In the later stages of the war however, they were increasingly used as tank substitutes, because there was often nothing else available."

It entered service late in the war (1944) and saw service on the Eastern and Western fronts. The Grampanzer combined the very powerful 8.8 cm PaK 43 cannon of the Nothung and the characteristically excellent armor and suspension of the Siegfried chassis, although it suffered from the general poor state of Germany in the later part of the war, which resulted in small production numbers, shortage in spare parts and poor crew training."

The rear turret was higher so it could shoot over the first one. Despite two engines its speed would have been low, weighing 140 tons. The primary purpose of the tank was to breach German fortification lines, not to fight enemy tanks, but its massive armor and weaponry meant it could function in either role. "
