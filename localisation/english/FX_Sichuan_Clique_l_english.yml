### Parties
SCH_vanguardist_party: "KMT"
SCH_vanguardist_party_long: "Kuomintang\n§gThe Kuomintang's influence in Sichuan is primarily felt through the presence Officer Department's guerrilla forces, secretive political clubs in the urban city centres and in rural communes throughout the countryside. Among these, it is the Officer Department which can wield the most direct political power and stands a slim but still plausible chance of bringing the three principles to Sichuan. Yet they are also moderate and cautious, whilst the radical propagandist and peasant leaders adhere to more irreverent, reckless displays of ideological fanaticism. Those few organisations within the province who preach such extreme beliefs as Syndicalism or Wang Jingwei Thought remain a helpful asset to the Officer Department, but largely powerless on their own.§!"

SCH_social_democrat_party: "Officer Department"
SCH_social_democrat_party_long: "Officer Department (Junguan Xi)\n§gThe Officer Department emerged as a political force in Sichuan after Tang Jiyao's invasion of the region in 1931, wherein numerous republican aligned officers were recruited to Yunnan's side and organised into a rival Sichuan government in an attempt to weaken Yang Sen's legitimacy. Whilst Tang Jiyao's invasion failed and the officers were driven into hiding as a weakened guerrilla force, their radical political legacy still endures.\n\nAmong those who rallied under Tang's banner were numerous Kuomintang generals, chief among them Lü Chao, who sought to bring peace and stability to Sichuan in the form of implementing Sun Yat Sen's famous three revolutionary principles. Whilst Lü Chao may have alienated many of his colleagues, thanks to his political ambitions and leftist beliefs, he has gained a sizeable following among younger, more radical recruits, who have eagerly flocked to his vision to destroy the warlordism and corruption that has plagued Sichuan for decades.§!"
SCH_social_liberal_party: "Officer Department"
SCH_social_liberal_party_long: "Officer Department (Junguan Xi)\n§gThe Officer Department emerged as a political force in Sichuan after Tang Jiyao's invasion of the region in 1931, wherein numerous republican aligned officers were recruited to Yunnan's side and organised into a rival Sichuan government in an attempt to weaken Yang Sen's legitimacy. Whilst Tang Jiyao's invasion failed and the officers were driven into hiding as a weakened guerrilla force, their radical political legacy still endures.\n\nOne of Tang's personally handpicked leaders for the Officer Department was an old colleague, Xiong Kewu, a former governor of the province who had administered it during the Xinhai Revolution. Xiong and Tang shared many political principles, most notably in regards to Federalism, but Xiong had an independent streak and desired to run the Officer Department himself, free of the Yunnan Clique's heavy handed political influence. He eventually worked to organise an independent base of power, joining forces with old friends and enemies, such as Lü Chao and other senior officers to operate free of Tang's meddling.§!"
SCH_market_liberal_party: "Baoding Department"
SCH_market_liberal_party_long: "Baoding Department (Baoding Xi)\n§gAs its name implies, the Baoding Department was formed by graduates of the Baoding military academy and officers of the Baoding army, who either originated in Sichuan or found themselves stationed in the province. Although they are considered politically liberal and fiscally responsible, the Baoding Department has earned a reputation for favouritism and nepotism, as well as frequently interfering with Yang Sen's government. Liu Wenhui, the uncle of the infamous Industrial Corps leader Liu Xiang, perhaps best embodies the liberal politics of these senior generals, with his laissez-faire approach to governance, he has conceded much ideological ground to the well-educated and well-meaning progressives in his department, as long as he can maintain his hold over Sichuan's opium production and foreign policy. Although this has led to some radical reforms, some believe Wenhui's greed and ambition ultimately hinders Sichuan's potential.§!"
SCH_social_conservative_party: "Baoding Department"
SCH_social_conservative_party_long: "Baoding Department (Baoding Xi)\n§gAs its name implies, the Baoding Department was formed by graduates of the Baoding military academy and officers of the Baoding army, who either originated in Sichuan or found themselves stationed in the province. Although they are considered politically liberal and fiscally responsible, the Baoding Department has earned a reputation for favouritism and nepotism, as well as frequently interfering with Yang Sen's government. Deng Xihou's faction within the Baoding Department is quite idealistic and believes in implementing genuine reforms, unlike some of his more pragmatic peers which merely pay lip service to these ideals. Deng's name is almost synonymous with fiscal responsibility thanks to his “Model Province Project”. To implement these impressive reforms he has built up extensive connections in the Sichuan, allowing him to greatly influence the government's military as well as economic developments.§!"
SCH_authoritarian_democrat_party: "Armament Department"
SCH_authoritarian_democrat_party_long: "Armament Department (Wubei Xi)\n§gThe Armament Department enjoyed a half decade of prestige after Yang Sen was recognised as the legitimate ruler of Sichuan by the Zhili Clique, but the bold and cunning general slowly witnessed his grip slip away. The Yunnan Clique's invasion of his province was the last straw which corroded his authority, putting much of Sichuan back in the hands of warlords and radicals. The Armament Department was forced to adapt to these disastrous circumstances and reluctantly invited several of these key warlords to join the government.\n\nYang since then strove to rebuild his authority over Sichuan, but faced great resistance from the newly emboldened warlords, as well as opportunists within his own clique such as the Confucian general Liu Cunhou and the leader of the bandit suppression army, Tian Songyao. Much of the department doubts if Yang can maintain this moribund, decentralised government much longer. His generals eagerly hope he will at last reign in the warlords, or finally give up and make way for a more aggressive leader like Cunhou. Without a firebrand like him to egg them on however, the generals may very well fall back in line behind Yang.§!"
SCH_paternal_autocrat_party: "Industrial Corps"
SCH_paternal_autocrat_party_long: "Industrial Corps (Shiye Tuan)\n§gThe enormous army of the Industrial Corps, led by Chongqing warlord Liu Xiang, is frequently derided by Zhili Loyalists and progressive officers as nothing more than a host of bandits. Whilst it is true that his oversized military favours quantity over quality and has certain moral failures, the Industrial Corps have accomplished great things thanks to their raw manpower and their intense firepower. The fact that Xiang has managed to keep his hold over south-eastern Sichuan as well keep his countless men paid and fed is testament to this fact.\n\nAfter being passed up for governorship of Sichuan and left bereft of any recognition from the Zhili Clique he had once so loyally served, Liu Xiang turned his attention towards taking what he declared was rightfully his, now by force and cunning. He has pushed for genuine modernisation and economic reforms, caring little for short term profits from bandit and opium selling when there is so much more up for grab, should the Industrial Corps successfully expand their influence over Sichuan. These aggressive policies mean Xiang's army and his reforms both rely on raw momentum, a single mislaid plan or an unexpected roadblock in his path could grind his ambitions to a halt.§!"
SCH_national_populist_party: "Yiguandao"
SCH_national_populist_party_long: "Yiguandao\n§gThe Yiguandao Cult has over recent years maintained contact with a handful of pockets of convinced adherents situated in the province of Sichuan. Most of these communities are grouped around isolated villages, or part of military hosts belonging to particularly zealous and fanatical generals. As such they are difficult for the Great Master to directly influence, but they nonetheless remain a great symbol for Zhang Tianran's pan-national ambitions of elevating China spiritually as well as materially out of its century of humiliation and infighting.§!"
