#### Events ####

lba.1.t: "The last of the Senussi Order"
lba.1.d: "In the wake of several brutal repressions orchestrated by the Italian commander Italo Balbo, the once powerful Senussi order is in disarray. Currently they flee to their base at Kurfa in British controlled Egypt. This inadvertent amnesty from the Egyptian government has been a thorn in our side for years. Every time we pursue the guerrillas they flee outside our sovereignty where they can regroup and organize in safety. Our continued demands for the British to clamp down on the Senussi have fallen on deaf ears. Commander Balbo now plans to lead an operation into Kufra to dismantle the Senussi once and for all, ignoring Egyptian sovereignty."
lba.1.a: "The British have left us no choice"
#
lba.2.t: "Italian patrols cross into Egypt"
lba.2.d: "For years Italy has accused the Sultan in Egypt of harboring guerrilla fighters from the Libyan Senussi order. Today though without any warning a detachment of the Italian garrison of Libya have crossed into the Western Desert, attacking the oasis of Kufra. The attack was brief but decisive, The Italian forces even rumored to have captured Omar Mukhtar, the Senussi leader. No matter the success of this operation it is in clear violation of Egyptian sovereignty."
lba.2.a: "Ask London to pressure Italy to respect our border"
lba.2.b: "Maybe we should turn a blind eye to this"
#
lba.3.t: "The Kufra incident"
lba.3.d: "Recently it has come to the attention of Rome that our commander in Libya, Italo Balbo, has lead a unsanctioned and illegal invasion into British controlled Egypt to crush the Senussi Order whom have been leading a guerrilla conflict against Italian forces in Libya for nearly a decade. While the invasion in question did lead to the capture of the Senussi leader Omar Mukhtar it has put us at odds with the British Empire. To avoid further amplifying the conflict Britain, on the behest of the Sultan of Egypt, demands we make an official apology over the incident and respect Egypt's border in the future. While the PPI supports appeasing London many nationalists factions see this as an insult and any reconciliation with London to be a major sign of weakness. Balbo's growing National Populist party, the ANI, has even organized a demonstration in Rome to show their support for his decisive action. While our internal parties bicker over the legitimacy of Balbo's actions, the international community wishes to keep peace in Europe."
lba.3.a: "Issue the apology, reprimand Balbo"
lba.3.b: "Italy stands behind her commanders"
#
lba.4.t: "Omar Mukhtar captured"
lba.4.d: "Our operation into Egyptian controlled Kufra has been a major success. The Senussi leader Omar Mukhtar has been captured and is being brought to Benghazi to await his trial. With their leader gone what is left of the Senussi Order will slowly fall apart. It is clear that the war in Libya is reaching it's end. While many officials once worried about the response from Rome over Balbo's action, this great victory for Italy will surely over shadow those details."
lba.4.a: "The ends ultimately justify the means"
#
lba.5.t: "Rome reprimands Italo Balbo"
lba.5.d: "Yielding to British pressure Italy has officially apologized for the illegal actions of commander Italo Balbo. Despite the success of Balbo's pacification efforts in Libya, Rome refuses to publicly support him but privately it is rumored that this action is only to save face and wont have lasting effects on Balbo's military career."
lba.5.a: "The government of Rome is spineless"
#
lba.6.t: "Balbo wants to return to Rome"
lba.6.d: "The defeat of the Senussi order in Libya has signaled the end of Balbo's role in the colony. The increasing turmoil back in Rome has pressured the commander to step back into his role as 'Duce' of the Associazione Nazionalista Italiana and lead his party through the upcoming election."
lba.6.a: "Balbo announces his return"
#
lba.7.t: "Italo Balbo returns from Libya"
lba.7.d: "General Balbo has landed in Rome today after his last victory in Cyrenaica, thanks to his war effort we can now finally exercise control over the whole Libyan Region. The usual greeting for occasion like this is the Blessing from the King and a meeting, but General Balbo is considered dangerous by many. He and his Associazione Nazionalista Italiana party have a history of political violence. During the Red Biennium ANI's paramilitary Blueshirts attacked socialists and even state police. He claims to have changed since those tumultuous times, but his recent autocratic attitude shown in Libya is seen by many opponents as a sign of his continued violent leadership. What shall we do now?"
lba.7.a: "He shall receive a hero's welcome"
lba.7.b: "He's too ambitious. We must underplay his victory in Libya"
#
lba.8.t: "The Senussi Estates"
lba.8.d: "With the capture of Omar Mukhtar many former warriors of the Senussi are returning to civilian life, attempting to live a normal life despite their past history. The war in Libya was a major expense for Italy. It has been suggested that Senussi estates could be confiscated as a form of reparations to be given to Italian settlers. While this is popular with the Italians living in Libya it is highly unpopular with the native population."
lba.8.a: "The Senussi must pay for their crimes"
lba.8.b: "We must promote reconciliation"
#
lba.9.t: "Libyans occupy government building in Tripoli"
lba.9.d: "The 1917 Treaty of Acroma was suppose to give Libya autonomy under Italian rule but after the Great War most of the treaty's provisions were undone and Libya continued to be ruled like Italy's other colonies. This was not popular with Libyans to say the least. With the controversial capture and imprisonment of Omar Mukhtar a group of Libyan intellectuals have decided to occupy an Italian administrative facility in Tripoli. They have given a list of grievances to the local press which mostly pertain to the treatment of Mukhtar but also include objections to the increasing Italian population in Libyan cities and the obvious economic and legal benefits these immigrants have over the local population. Police are ready to remove protesters as soon as we give the word."
lba.9.a: "Criminals must be punished"
lba.9.b: "We should at least listen to their grievances"
#
lba.10.t: "Italy ends the military government in Libya"
lba.10.d: "Ever since becoming a possession of the Italian empire in 1912, Libya has increasingly fallen under the influence of the Italian military. While many argued this was needed to maintain stability within the colony the effects of this occupation have been disastrous for the region and her people. Most native Libyans are 2nd class citizens and consistently treated with suspicion by the Italian authorities. The war with the Senussi Order has cost Italy millions of Liras all the while leaving Libya's infrastructure in disarray. Rome now believes the best course of action is to allow Libya to exist as an autonomous nation within Rome's sphere of influence. Until a suitable local leader can be picked a Provisional Government will be crated to handle the administration of Libya for the mean time."
lba.10.a: "A bright future for Libya is right around the corner."
#
lba.11.t: "Italy installs Idris I as king of Libya"
lba.11.d: "Idris I is a controversial figure to say the least. Born into the Senussi Order, he had been part of guerrilla forces that plagued Libya for decades but he was one of the few leaders wiling to seek compromise with the Italians. As a popular figure amongst the Libyan population, it's believed that Idris I shall be able to bring stability and peace to the region while maintaining positive relations with Rome."
lba.11.a: "Long live the king!"

ITA_guerrilla_conflict: "Guerrilla Conflict"
ITA_guerrilla_conflict_desc: "For over a decade the Senussi Order has lead a guerrilla campaign against Italian forces in Libya. The Senussi leader, Omar Mukhtar, calls for the total independence of Libya from imperial rule. To achieve this his troops attack our cities and infrastructure in quick and daring raids usually at the dead of night. This chaos has hampered the development of Libya as many Italian industrialists are weary to invest in such a violent region. Several recent victories by Italian commander Italo Balbo have pushed the Senussi back into the Libyan desert but only time will tell if this is the beginning of a major breakthrough."
