### Parties (still from KR)
PRR_vanguardist_party: "PCP (Rates)"
PRR_vanguardist_party_long: "Partido Comunista Português (Rates)\n§gFollowing his expulsion in 1926, following a refusal to collaborate with the collectivist-dominated CGT, former General Secretary José Carlos Rates has created his own splinter organisation still standing firm on an opposition of anarchist collaboration. Still holding influence over an older contingent of Communists, Rates has grown inspired by the revisionist, nationalistic vanguardist school of thought during his time in France. If he were to take back control of the Party, Rates would likely take his revenge against the ascendant left-wing that ousted him and implement a technocratic, socialist system to safeguard the revolution from within and without.§!"
PRR_collectivist_party: "CUFU (CGT/FAP)"
PRR_collectivist_party_long: "Comité de Unidade de Frente Única\n§gFormed with José de Sousa's alliance between the Communists and Trade Unions, the United Front Committee of Unions currently exists as a grouping of socialists, imprisoned and exiled in Paris following the failed 1930 General Strike. The General Confederation of Labour and the Portuguse Anarchist Federation are two interlinked factions, making up the collectivist bulwark of the United Front. The CGT is nominally led by founder Manuel Joaquim de Sousa from prison, who is represented by José da Silva Santos Arranha in Paris. The CGT is considered to be the most militant revolutionary group within Portugal, and has subsequently faced the most repression from Lisbon. The Portuguse Anarchist Federation is a wing of the Iberian Anarchist Federation, forming another political front for the CGT. Though de Sousa is a supporter of Pan-Iberian Unity, many within the CGT are at best sceptical, or at worst outwardly hostile to this position.§!"
PRR_libertarian_socialist_party: "CUFU (PCP/FAO)"
PRR_libertarian_socialist_party_long: "Comité de Unidade de Frente Única\n§gFormed with José de Sousa's alliance between the Communists and Trade Unions, the United Front Committee of Unions currently exists as a grouping of socialists, imprisoned and exiled in Paris following the failed 1930 General Strike. The Portuguse Communist Party has struggled since the Restoration. Under the leadership of Bento António Gonçalves, they've operated on a policy of cooperation with the Anarchists and collectivists, a departure from the hostitly towards them under José Carlos Rates. By following a line of pragmatism towards the revolution, the Communists hope that the United Front strategy will bare fruit in time. The Federação Socialista das Associações de Trabalhadores (Socialist Federation of Workers' Associations) represents the moderate socialist trade unionists under the United Front, who maintain a presense within Portugal due to the lack of radical actions undertaken by them. Their small size has relegated them to an intermediary role between the CGT and the PCP.§!"
PRR_social_democrat_party: "PRED"
PRR_social_democrat_party_long: "Partido Republicano da Esquerda Democrática\n§gThe Democratic Leftwing Republican Party is a marxist, democratic-socialist party that formed in 1924, having split from Democratic Party following an ideological dispute with Afonso Costa. Leader José Domingues dos Santos has built the PRED around 'Moderação', an attempt to find a third way between the revolutionary syndicalism espoused by the Third Internationale, and the progressive liberalism of the Democrats. The failure of the 1930 General Strike has seen the PRED gain a small amount of steam among more radical minded exiles, though the CUFU still regards them with intense suspicion.§!"
PRR_social_liberal_party: "PRP"
PRR_social_liberal_party_long: "Partido Republicano Português\n§gThe Democratic Party, offically called the Portuguese Republican Party, is a centre-left, progressive party which is the self-proclaimed successor to the original Republican Party which led the 1910 republican revolution. Formed in Feburary 1912 by Afonso Costa after the old Republican Party splintered, the Democrats were the politically dominant movement (with somewhat authoritarian tendancies) for much of the Republic's existence, until Sidonio Pais cemented his power in 1917 after which they acted as the main opposition to the conservative military dictatorship. After the restoration of the monarchy, Costa led his followers into exile and the party can be tied to almost every insurrectionist attempt to overthrow the monarchy since. Following Costa's retirement in 1931, the Democrats have been locked in a factional struggle between the populist lieutenant-colonel Liberato Pinto, who wants to reform the big-tent Democratic Party of old, and Costa's former deputy António Maria da Silva, a detail-orentated politician focused on consolidating the parties current ideology.§!"
PRR_market_liberal_party: "URN (Liberais)"
PRR_market_liberal_party_long: "União Republicana Nacionalista\n§gThe Nationalist Republican Union, colloquially referred to as the Nationalists, is a liberal-conservative party, formed in exile in February 1923, as a merger of the Republican Liberal Party, the Reconstitution Party and the remnants of the National Republican Party. The Nationalists were created to provide a stronger base to stand against the restored Monarchy, uniting the right-wing republicans under one banner. Their views are mixed, representing a wide range of interests and ideals, with their main unifying ideology being one of 'Anti-Democrático', or strong opposition to the Democratic Party. The Nationalists are not led by one particular man, but rather have collective leadership with a variety center-right & right-wing politicians. The 'Liberals' are a classical-liberal faction made up predominantly of former Republican Liberal and Reconstitution Party members, cheifly led by the charismatic António Granjo. The Liberals champion economic liberalisation above anything else, supporting a grand opening of trade to the wider world. Granjo's charismatic influence has ensured the Liberals are generally the dominant faction.§!"
PRR_social_conservative_party: "URN (Unionista)"
PRR_social_conservative_party_long: "União Republicana Nacionalista\n§gThe Nationalist Republican Union, colloquially referred to as the Nationalists, is a liberal-conservative party, formed in exile in February 1923, as a merger of the Republican Liberal Party, the Reconstitution Party and the remnants of the National Republican Party.

The Nationalists are not led by one particular man, but rather have collective leadership with a variety center-right & right-wing politicians. The 'Unionists' are a socially-conservative faction, led by Francisco da Cunha Leal and made up predominantly of former 'Sidonistas' and Catholic republicans. The Unionists support culturally conservative ventures, being the most clerically friendly of any Republican group. Under Cunha Leal's influence, they've also support a broad review of Portugal's colonial ventures.§!"
PRR_authoritarian_democrat_party: "PCC"
PRR_authoritarian_democrat_party_long: "Partido do Centro Católico\n§gThe Catholic Centre Party formed in January 1915, with the intial goal of representing Catholic interests in the anti-clerical Republic. Not explicitly monarchist at first, that anti-clericalism naturally drew the Catholics into opposition. When the Republic began to collapse, the Catholic Centre withdrew their support, with some key members turning to royalist militancy themselves. Following the Restoration, the Catholic Centre was the largest formal political party in the Royal Congress. Amid the disastrous year of 1925, the 'Centrists' reconciled with the Integralists following Hipólito Raposo's more pragmatic stance on political cooperation. Backing the coup in 1926, the Catholics now dominate the Chamber of Peers and have come to support a German-style semi-constitutional monarchy. Since a factional dispute in 1920, ardent monarchist and integralist sympathiser José Fernando de Sousa has led the party, though his advancing age has led a younger caucus of members around Professor António Salazar to gain prominence.§!"
PRR_paternal_autocrat_party: "CCM"
PRR_paternal_autocrat_party_long: "Conselho de Causa Monárquica\n§gAn umbrella of many royalists, the Council of the Monarchist Cause represents the shaky "Monarchist Cause" coalition-party that ruled Portugal during the government of Henrique de Paiva Couceiro of 1921-1926, and was initally formed in 1911 to pursue a restoration of the Monarchy. When the then-political party was banned following the March 17th Coup, the members of the Cause were politically isolated from King Manuel II and forced to be mere spectators of the Organic Experiment. With the coronation of Duarte II however, the royalist coalition would have a new opportunity to reassert themselves within Portugal. Though the Monarchist Cause's official purpose is the continued protection and strengthening of monarchist institutions, their secretive aim is a 'National Restoration' to empower the Monarch and form a conservative personalist dictatorship around them, whilst culling the various excesses of the ultra-radical Integralist regime. The Council's principle leaders are Marshal Couceiro and Domingos Fezas Vital, Lieutenant of the King.§!"
PRR_national_populist_party: "IL"
PRR_national_populist_party_long: "Integralismo Lusitano\n§gThe Lusitanian Integralist movement was born at the University of Coimbra in 1911, though the group wasnt founded until 1914. The group quickly became known as a counter-culture movement to the Republic, espousing an highly reactionary, traditionalist and elitist outlook on politics. Extremely anti-liberal and ultra-monarchist, the Integralists fought against the Democrats and the Republican system, though Integralist politicians cooperated with the Sidonist 'New Republic' dictatorship. As the restoration began, the Integralists were one of the most influential factions of the counter-revolutionaries. However, after the restoration, the Integralist's stagnated; viewed as dangerous by Couceiro, they were politically sidelined. Antonio Sardinha's sudden death threatened to collapse the organisation, but Hipólito Raposo rationalised the groups erosteric, often contradictory ideology and reconciled with other political groups, chiefly the Catholic Centre. After the disastrious year of 1925, the Integralists were able to lead a largely bloodless coup against the Causa Monárquica and swiftly consolidate power. Ever since, Raposo has put the Integralist's more radical ambitions on hold, which has led to discontent within the Central Junta.§!"
