SAU_building_economy: "Building an Economy"
SAU_building_economy_desc: "As one can easily see, our economy is not in the best shape. Poverty is rampant, desperation is ever-growing, and even the little industry we have is owned by the British. How are we supposed to guard our sovereignty, ensure peace, defend ourselves or even prevent starvation without a proper economy? This cannot be any longer. We must utilize every possible tool at our disposal to make our nation great."
SAU_house_of_learning: "Houses of Learning"
SAU_house_of_learning_desc: "Illiteracy is rampant, much of the population have never even been to school. Our education system is practically non-existent.

We shall create houses of learning, educational institutions where our citizens will forge the country's and their future."
SAU_seize_british_assets: "Seize British Assets"
SAU_seize_british_assets_desc: "The British. Treacherous, greedy, dishonest, and uncivilized scum. They are the ones who enslaved our nation for more than a decade, they are responsible for our defeat against the Hashemites. Their miserable existence itself is a grave mistake. Yet the Anglos continue stealing from us to this day. The sweat and blood of our people along with our natural resources go straight into their pockets, an entire continent away. We shall take back what is rightfully ours and the British shall receive the dreadful fate of thieves."
SAU_find_oil_traders: "Find Oil Trading Partners"
SAU_find_oil_traders_desc: "Our land is naturally blessed with an abundance of oil. As the global need for fuel is ever-rising, many would be willing to take it off our hands. As we lack infrastructure for its refinement and possess plentitude, it is only logical to export it. Two great powers would be more than grateful to buy our oil. One is France, and the other is Germany. Both would be stable and credible partners, yet many in our government see the French as no better imperialists than the British, and others worry about whatever our place would be in the German's 'new order'."
SAU_construct_railway: "Riyadh-Dammam Railway"
SAU_construct_railway_desc: "Much of our beloved country is covered by deserts, making traveling from one city to another rather difficult and time-consuming. Yet to properly bring our nation into the 20th century we must overcome this. For this reason, our architects came up with the brilliant idea of the Riyadh-Dammam Railway.

SAU_invite_advisors: "Invite Foreign Economic Advisors"
SAU_invite_advisors_desc: "As our economy continues to gradually grow, we are confronted with an issue: a lack of valuable expertise.

As they bear immense knowledge in the field, they could significantly speed up our industrialization."
SAU_oil_expansion: "Prospect for Oil"
SAU_oil_expansion_desc: "As the demand for oil rises higher and higher, we shall naturally begin to look for more deposits around our country.

SAU_fund_farming: "Subsidize Farming"
SAU_fund_farming_desc: "Many foreigners naively think of our country as one giant, barely habitable desert. They couldn't be more wrong. Several regions, for example, possess exceptionally favorable climates for agriculture. Yet many of them aren't utilized to the best of their potential. To correct this, we shall support our farmers by subsidizing fertilizer, modern equipment, and everything necessary. This shall be a substantial step towards economic greatness and self-sufficiency."
SAU_wheat_imports: "Wheat Imports"
SAU_wheat_imports_desc: "As our agricultural capacities haven't reached satisfactory levels yet, we still require a steady flow of foreign wheat. While some would falsely call this a betrayal of the idea of self-sufficiency, they don't comprehend the importance of food security.

SAU_import_tools: "Import Industrial Tools"
SAU_import_tools_desc: "Despite our efforts, our industrial capacities are still lacking. While we now have foreign professionals, we still require modern tools. Hand-made goods might maintain an incredibly long tradition, yet they are outclassed in every single way by goods made in factories with up-to-date machinery. We can never become a truly modern country, a jewel in the East, a center of production, if we don't possess the proper tools."

This division shall be dealt with if we ever want to achieve our destiny as a world power. We are, of course, the best suited to lead this soon-to-be union. Our crusade for unification shall begin."
SAU_anti_imperialist_bulwark: "Anti-Imperialist Bulwark"
SAU_anti_imperialist_bulwark_desc: "The specter of colonialism was one experienced by all of the East. No matter Sunni or Shia, Egyptian or Syrian, we were all repressed by Europeans the same way. The grim reality is that some of our brethren still wear these chains. Only in unity can we be strong enough to liberate ourselves from the vile colonialists. We shall become an anti-imperialist bulwark, establishing an alliance of like-minded nations to combat European aggression in the region."
SAU_demand_azir: "Demand Asir"
SAU_demand_azir_desc: ""
SAU_attack_yemen: "Finish Off Yemen"
SAU_attack_yemen_desc: "Now that Asir is under our control, where it rightfully belongs, we shall finish off the rump state of Yemen. They have been weakened so much, that the British are watching over them, like a vulture circling above a dying animal. We cannot allow the imperialists to stretch even more into our land. A special military operation to protect Yemenis from colonialism shall commence before the British could take over."
SAU_invite_yemen: "Invite Yemen"
SAU_invite_yemen_desc: "Our rightful acquisition of Asir has greatly weakened Yemen, making them vulnerable, especially to the British. In order to protect them, we shall invite Yemen to our alliance. While it might be simpler to invade them, it would also substantially damage our image with the Yemeni people. The last thing we want is to fight native resistance along with the imperialists."
SAU_attack_iraq: "The Last Hashemite"
SAU_attack_iraq_desc: "We might have defeated the vile Hashemites in our land, yet they are still in power north of us. They were the ones who overthrow our benevolent rule. They sold Arabia to the British imperialists. They cannot be allowed to stand anymore. Their eradication would not only cement our position as the true hegemon of Arabia but would serve as our revenge upon their bastard dynasty."
SAU_attack_lebanon: "Free Lebanon"
SAU_attack_lebanon_desc: "While the French may have aided us in the past, they still oppress our brethren in Lebanon, making them no better than the British. As such, they deserve the fate of Imperialistic thieves. Colonialism is colonialism, no matter which European power does it. An offensive must commence to liberate Lebanon from the vile yoke of colonialism."
SAU_attack_israel: "Capture Jerusalem"
SAU_attack_israel_desc: "Jerusalem has been historically a significant site for us, Muslims. We valiantly protected it from the many crusades. Yet today the Jews rule over our rightful land.

SAU_reconcile_iraq: "Reconcile with Mesopotamia"
SAU_reconcile_iraq_desc: "The Hashemites may have done considerable harm to us and Arabia in the past, yet that is irrelevant now. They could prove a valuable ally against imperialism, one that could be essential. We must overcome our past and seek reconciliation with them immediately. We cannot ever defeat an external enemy if we remain divided."
SAU_invite_egypt: "Invite Egypt"
SAU_invite_egypt_desc: "Unfortunately, we weren't the only ones to have experienced the horror of colonialism. Egypt, just like us, has been oppressed by the Europeans. Utilizing this shared experience, we could unite behind the common goal of eradicating imperialism. They could prove an invaluable ally in the future. We shall invite Egypt to our pact."
SAU_demand_abu_dhabi: "Demand the Trucial States"
SAU_demand_abu_dhabi_desc: "Now that we have unified our efforts with the neighboring powers against imperialism, we are prepared to confront the vile Europeans. The Trucial States, a federation of Arab cities, would be a logical place to start. They have sold their people's freedom for protection from the British, yet they don't realize that they are only being exploited by the colonialists. We must step up and demand the immediate abolition of this injustice and the return of the Trucial States for those who can actually protect them, us."
SAU_provoke_oman_rebellion: "Provoke Omani Rebellion!"
SAU_provoke_oman_rebellion_desc: "The Omani people beg to be liberated. Tensions are exceptionally high between them and their overlords. The British are widely despised, yet not a single Omani seemed to oppose them as of now. We must make sure Oman can liberate itself, by providing them aid. When they are prepared, we shall ignite the powderkeg by creating a small "accident", hopefully causing open armed rebellion."


### Events
saudi.0.t: "Proclamation of the Third Saudi State"
saudi.0.d: "The demise of the Second Saudi State started when the Emir of Nejd and Hasa, Abdulaziz Ibn Saud, launched a military operation against the Emirate of Hejaz when the Sharif of Mecca, Hussein bin Ali refused the entry of pilgrims from Nejd at the start of the Hajj. Saudi forces easily occupied Medina, and nearby cities. However, the tide of the conflict turned against the Saudis when Hussein bin Ali, contacted the British for military support, in which the British happily accepted.\n\nOur archaic army composed of different tribes were no match for the modern weapons and training provided by the British to the Hejazi military, and thus, after the capture of Riyadh, the Emirate of Nejd was officially annexed by the Kingdom of Hejaz which in turn proclaimed the Hashemite Kingdom of Arabia. The London Stock Market Crash has severely weaked the British Empire and its effects have been disastrous for the Hashemites; and we took this opportunity to destroy the Hashemites, and reclaim what is rightfully ours!"
saudi.0.a: "We will win this time!"
saudi.2.t: "Defeat of the [From.GetAdjective]s"
saudi.2.d: "As our army marched to the capital of [From.GetName]; the capitulation of the [From.GetAdjective] Government have soon followed. The last holdouts of the [From.GetAdjective] troops have now successfully seized and destroyed and the instrument of formal surrender have now signed by their delegation."
saudi.2.a: "Glory to Allah!"
saudi.3.t: "Ikhwan Seizes Power"
saudi.3.d: "Our victory have come at the great cost against the Hashemites and the Rashidis, but the Sauds have managed to take control of the Arabian peninsula. However, as one of the first moves conducted by Ibn Saud as the new King is to disband the Ikhwan militias the helped him win the war, and thus made the Saudi-Ikhwan relations slowly souring.\n\nHowever, taking their chances, the Ikhwan launched a coup early this morning. Politicians, notables and suspected enemies of the movement were lifted from their beds and shots could be heard on the outskirts of Riyadh where the leaders of the old regime were brought to their early death.\n\nAs the Ikhwan parades through the streets of Riyadh, the Arabs looked at them with fear on their eyes, some have been quickly packing to escape to the border, in Abu Dhabi or the Mashriq Kingdom."
saudi.3.a: "Oh no..."
saudi.4.t: "Ikhwan Raid"
saudi.4.d: "One of our patrols in the Nejd region has stumbled across what remains of a smouldering village. The few panicked survivors first tried to hide from our unit but after one of our soldiers took off his cap and set aside his rifle, one of the survivors managed to get over his fear and tell a horrible story about the camel riders of the east who swarmed in to take prisoners off as slaves. Anyone who resisted did not see much fruit for their labours. Another soldier calls out that he can make out a faint trail moving east but a sandstorm appears to be moving up from the south..."
saudi.4.a: "After them!"
saudi.5.t: "Invitation to the Dammam Accords"
saudi.5.t.iraq: "Ibn Saud Visits Damascus"
saudi.5.d: "The Saudis have approached us with an invitation to their alliance, the Dammam Accords. Some think that this will strengthen us. However some think that the Offer is just a trick to get us to be subservient to the Ibn Saud's ambitions."
saudi.5.d.iraq: "[SAU.GetLeader] have recently arrived to Damascus as part of a diplomatic effort to establish ties with our nation and [SAU.GetName]. They offered us conciliation as the House of Saud were not particularly historically friendly with the Hashemites. However, the Saudi King were keen on establishing friendly ties with us, even inviting us to their alliance. Should we accept?"
saudi.5.a: "Where do we sign?"
saudi.5.b: "They're just expanding their influence"
saudi.6.t: "[From.GetAdjective] Government Accepts our Invitation"

saudi.7.a: "Damn it!"
saudi.8.t: "[From.GetName] Demands We Hand Over Asir"
saudi.8.d: "[From.GetNameDefCap] has sent us an ultimatum, stating that we shall immediately give up Asir to them. Their claim to Asir is hundreds of years old, but the [From.GetAdjective] government still speaks passionately about retaking 'lost land'. They say that if we do not cede the lands, they will have to take military action."
saudi.8.a: "We have to accept"
saudi.8.b: "They need to take it on our cold dead hands!"
saudi.9.t: "[From.GetName] Cedes Asir"

saudi.10.b: "War is not an option"
saudi.11.t: "Peace with Saudi Arabia?"
saudi.11.d: "The war with [From.GetNameDef] has not gone at all in our favour. Fortunately, they have offered us a peace deal, with us losing Asir."

saudi.11.b: "We will push them back!"
saudi.12.t: "[From.GetName] Accepts"
saudi.12.d: "The [From.GetNameDef] have accepted our proposal of peace."
saudi.12.a: "Peace in our time"
saudi.13.t: "[From.GetName] Refuses"
saudi.13.d: "The [From.GetNameDef] have refused our proposal of peace."
saudi.13.a: "Oh no..."
saudi.14.t: "[From.GetName] Demands We Hand Over the Trucial States"
saudi.14.d: "[From.GetNameDefCap], seeing our weakness, have taken the opportunity to demand the Trucial States from us. [From.GetName] has been trying to influence neighbouring nations more and more recently, trying to \"unite the Arabs\". This is evidently just another attempt at expansion, but we might need to focus on other issues."
saudi.14.a: "Give it to them"
saudi.14.b: "We do not fear them"
saudi.15.t: "[From.GetAdjective] Government Accepts our Demand"
saudi.15.d: "Since even before the Great War, the Trucial States have been under the cruel fist of the [ENG.GetAdjective]. But now, in their time of weakness, they have made the correct choice and ceded us the Trucial States."
saudi.15.a: "Good for them"
saudi.16.t: "[From.GetAdjective] Government Refuses our Demand"
saudi.16.d: "The [ENG.GetAdjective] have refused to give us the Trucial States. They are an important part of our previous lands, and with the weakness of the [ENG.GetAdjective], we can try and take it back."

saudi.17.t: "[From.GetName] Occupies the Trucial States!"
saudi.17.d: "Seeing our weakness, the [SAU.GetNameDefCap] have ordered their regiments on the border to have successfully marched and taken control of the Trucial States. Our garrisons in the area were taken by suprise and were ultimately surrendered to the [SAU.GetAdjective] units."

saudi.19.d: "The seeds layed in Oman have bore its fruit. Oman is now under open rebellion against the British, and we capitalize by extending to them the invitation to the Dammam Accords."
