# - Notes from SuperMarks
# - These strategy plans are enabled shortly after game-start following a hidden event being fired for AI Britain where five possible options are chosen with 20% chance for each.
# - Each of these options will dictate an 'objective' for AI UK to aim towards. They are as follows: Cape to Singapore (build railways bro), Squash Soviets (Lenin on suicide watch), Reform Entente (be best buds with France and restore the Entente Cordiale)
# - Isolationist Imperial Federation (Form the ImpFed and completely ignore global affairs until you do) and finally Challenge France (do everything in your power to kill France even if it means siding with the Germans).
# - There isn't much room for flexibility in these plans but by making good use of the abort command I will hopefully avoid silly situations (Yes I know this is HoI4. What do you mean that's wishful thinking?).
